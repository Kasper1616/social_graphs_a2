'''''Damn Yankees''''' is a 1955 [[musical comedy]] with a book by [[George Abbott]] and [[Douglass Wallop]], music and lyrics by [[Richard Adler]] and [[Jerry Ross (composer)|Jerry Ross]].  The story is a [[Works based on Faust|modern retelling]] of the [[Faust]] legend<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Fitzsimmons|editor1-first=Lorna|title=Lives of Faust: The Faust Theme in Literature and Music. A Reader|date=2008|publisher=Walter De Gruyter|location=New York|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SH2FQy3_DP4C&q=damn+Yankees&pg=PA12 |access-date=30 October 2018|isbn=9783110973976}}</ref> set during the 1950s in Washington, D.C., during a time when the [[New York Yankees]] dominated [[Major League Baseball]]. It is based on Wallop's 1954 novel ''[[The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant]]''.

The show ran for 1,019 performances in its original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. Adler and Ross's success with it and ''[[The Pajama Game]]'' seemed to point to a bright future for them, but Ross suddenly died of chronic [[bronchiectasis]] at age 29, several months after ''Damn Yankees'' opened.

==Plot==
'''Note''': The plot synopsis below describes the show as updated for its 1994 Broadway revival, which differed from the original 1955 production. For the 1958 film, which is closer to that original version, see [[Damn Yankees (film)|''Damn Yankees'' (film)]].

Middle-aged real estate agent Joe Boyd is a long-suffering fan of the pathetic [[History of the Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] [[baseball]] team. His wife, Meg, laments this ("Six Months Out Of Every Year"). After she has gone to bed, he sits up late, grumbling that if the Senators just had a "long ball hitter" they could beat "those damn Yankees". Suddenly, the smooth-talking, subtly demonic Mr. Applegate appears. He offers Joe the chance to become "Joe Hardy", the young slugger the Senators need. He accepts, even though he must leave Meg ("Goodbye Old Girl"). However, his business sense makes him insist on an escape clause. The Senators' last game is on September 25, and if he plays in it, he is to stay as Joe Hardy forever. If not, he has until 9:00 the night before to walk away from the deal and return to his normal life.

At the ballpark, the hapless Senators vow to play their best despite their failings ("Heart"). Then Joe Hardy is suddenly discovered and joins the team. Gloria Thorpe, a sports reporter, praises him ("Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo"). His hitting prowess enables the team to move up in the standings.

Though Joe is increasingly successful, he truly misses Meg and moves into her house as a [[Boarding house|boarder]] in his persona as Joe Hardy. They begin to bond, especially over her "lost" husband ("A Man Doesn't Know"). Fearful of losing his deal, Applegate calls Lola, "the best homewrecker on [his] staff", to seduce Joe and ensure his loss of the bet. She promises to deliver ("A Little Brains, A Little Talent"), and Applegate introduces her as a sultry South American dancer named "Señorita Lolita Banana". She sings a seductive song ("[[Whatever Lola Wants]]"), but Joe's devotion to Meg proves too strong, even for her. Applegate punishes her by firing her, where she performs with other past workers for Applegate ("Who's Got the Pain").

Applegate decides to switch tactics to ensure Joe's failure. He releases false information about Joe's true identity being "Shifty McCoy", an escaped criminal and [[con artist]]. When Gloria discovers this information, she presses charges, and he is forced into court.
  
The Senators prepare for the final game against the Yankees for the pennant and worry about Joe, but they vow to think of nothing but winning ("The Game"). Meanwhile, angry fans are seeking him out, so he decides to leave home. As he does so, he hints to Meg that her old husband is nearby ("Near to You"). Meanwhile, Applegate is exhausted by the work he has put into winning one bet and thinks about the "simpler" times in his long history ("Those Were the Good Old Days").

Joe's trial is held on September 24, the last day he can back out of his deal. As he technically does not exist, he cannot produce any kind of identification. The owner of the Senators, their coach, and even Lola (disguised as "Señora McCoy") testify, but their opinions carry no weight. Gloria suggests that Applegate take the stand, but he is unable to take the oath since it requires him to tell the truth. Joe realizes that Applegate is simply stalling to keep him from meeting his 9:00 deadline. Applegate claims that Joe "just needs time to think" and sends him to where Lola is, where history's most famous lovers wait. Lola meets him there and realizes that he truly loves Meg. She helps him by sending him into the final game and delays Applegate by coercing him into a duet ("Two Lost Souls").

When Applegate finally arrives at the game, it is 8:55, and Joe is at bat. As time runs out, Meg, her friends, and even Lola begin cheering for him. Applegate uses his powers to give Joe two strikes. The clock strikes nine, and Applegate claims victory, but at the last second, Joe cries, "Let me go!" The deal is broken, and he reverts to his old self but is still able to hit a home run, winning the pennant for the Senators.
  
Back at home, Joe rushes into Meg's arms. Applegate appears on the scene, claiming that Joe owes him his prize. He begs Meg to hold him and not let go, and she begins to sing ("Finale (A Man Doesn't Know)"). Applegate promises to make him young again and even ensure a [[World Series]] victory. But his powers are useless against their true love, which Lola points out. He shouts that such a thing cannot exist, but he is wrong. He and Lola vanish back to where they came from, defeated, with Joe and Meg united.

=== 2025 Revisions ===
The [[Arena Stage]] production introduces a revised book from Will Power and Doug Wright. In this version, the setting and team are changed from the Senators to the [[2000 Baltimore Orioles season|2000 Baltimore Orioles]], and there are several references to the [[culture of Baltimore]]. Additionally, the plot point of Joe being framed as a con artist is changed to him being involved in a potential [[Doping in baseball|doping scandal]], and there is a character trait of his father being a player in the [[Negro league baseball|Negro leagues]].

==Productions==

=== Original Broadway production ===
The producers [[Harold Prince|Frederick Brisson, Robert E. Griffith and Harold S. Prince]]<ref>Original 1955 Playbill, p.11</ref> had decided that the lead actress for the part of "Lola" had to be a dancer. They offered the role to both the movie actress [[Mitzi Gaynor]] and ballet dancer [[Zizi Jeanmaire]], each of whom turned down the role. Although [[Gwen Verdon]] had sung just one song in her previous show (''Can-Can''), the producers were willing to take a chance on her. She initially refused, preferring to assist another choreographer, but finally agreed. Choreographer [[Bob Fosse]] insisted on meeting her before working with her, and after meeting and working for a brief time, they each agreed to the arrangement.<ref>''All His Jazz: The Life & Death of Bob Fosse'', Martin Gottfried, 1998, pp. 94-95, Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-80837-4}}</ref> This was the start of an artistic and personal partnership between Fosse and Verdon, who married in 1960.

The show opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[46th Street Theatre]] on May 5, 1955, transferred to the [[Adelphi Theatre (New York City)|Adelphi Theatre]] on May 17, 1957, and ran for a total of 1,019 performances. It was directed by [[George Abbott]], with scenery and costumes by [[William and Jean Eckart]], dances and musical numbers staged by Fosse, musical direction by Hal Hastings, orchestrations by [[Don Walker (orchestrator)|Don Walker]], and dance music arrangements by Roger Adams.

The show starred [[Ray Walston]] (Applegate), Verdon (Lola), [[Shannon Bolin]] (Meg), Robert Shafer (Joe Boyd), Elizabeth Howell (Doris), [[Stephen Douglass]] (Joe Hardy), Al Lanti (Henry), Eddie Phillips (Sohovik), Nathaniel Frey (Smokey), Albert Linville (Vernon, Postmaster), [[Russ Brown (actor)|Russ Brown]] (Van Buren), [[James Komack|Jimmy Komack]] (Rocky), [[Rae Allen]] (Gloria), Cherry Davis (Teenager), Del Horstmann (Lynch, Commissioner), Richard Bishop (Welch), Janie Janvier (Miss Weston),  and [[Jean Stapleton]] (Sister).

=== Original West End production ===
A [[West End theatre|West End]] production played at the [[London Coliseum]] beginning on March 28, 1957, where it played for 258 performances.<ref>Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/1950s.htm ''Damn Yankees''] musicals101.com</ref> It starred Olympic skater [[Belita]] (aka Gladys Lyne Jepson-Turner) as Lola, but the Fosse choreography was alien to her style, and she was replaced by [[Elizabeth Seal]].<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051227/ai_n15960542 Obituary of Belita] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224065825/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051227/ai_n15960542 |date=2008-12-24 }}</ref> It also starred [[Bill Kerr]] as Applegate, and [[Ivor Emmanuel]] as Joe Hardy.

In the mid-1970s, [[Vincent Price]] starred as Applegate in summer stock productions of the show. In the late 1970s and early 1980s film actor [[Van Johnson]] did so in productions throughout the U.S.A. In July, 1981, a production was performed at the [[Jones Beach Marine Theater]] in [[Wantagh, New York]]. It was notable due to former [[New York Jets]] quarterback [[Joe Namath]] being cast in the role of Joe Boyd.<ref>[https://www.csmonitor.com/1981/0709/070902.html csmonitor.com]</ref>

=== Broadway revival ===

J. Benjamin]] as Joe Boyd, and [[Cheyenne Jackson]] as Joe Hardy. [[John Rando]] directed and the original Fosse choreography was reproduced by Mary MacLeod.

==Recordings, film, and television==
{{more citations needed section|date=August 2018}}
The 1955 Original Broadway Cast recording is on RCA Victor, recorded May 8, 1955. The LP was originally issued in mono but in 1965 RCA Victor offered an electronic stereo version. The current CD edition was released in 1988.<ref>''The New York Times'', John S. Wilson, June 26, 1955, pg. X10</ref>  RCA Victor also released the film soundtrack in 1958. Although recorded in stereo, only the mono version was released. The 1989 CD edition marked the first release of the recording in stereo. The 1994 Broadway revival cast recording  made by Mercury (and now on the Decca Broadway label) was released on May 17, 1994.

[[Damn Yankees (film)|A film version]], directed by George Abbott and [[Stanley Donen]], was released in 1958. With the exception of [[Tab Hunter]] in the role of Joe Hardy (replacing [[Stephen Douglass]]), the Broadway principals reprised their stage roles.<ref>[https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/72117/damn-yankees ''Damn Yankees''] tcm.com, retrieved August 16, 2018</ref><ref name=notes>[https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/72117/damn-yankees#notes " ''Damn Yankeess'' Notes"] tcm.com, retrieved August 16, 2018</ref>

A [[Damn Yankees! (1967 film)|made-for-TV movie version]] was broadcast April 8, 1967, on [[NBC]], with [[Phil Silvers]] as Applegate, [[Lee Remick]] as Lola, and [[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]] as Joe Boyd.<ref name=notes/><ref>Terrace, Vincent. ''Damn Yankees'', ''Television Specials: 5,336 Entertainment Programs, 1936-2012'', 2nd ed., McFarland, 2013, {{ISBN|0786474440}}, p. 117</ref>

In 1983,  Ray Walston expressed interest in recreating Applegate in ''Raisin' Cane'', a new musical in which the devil returns to ruin Broadway. In a spin on ''Damn Yankees'', this time Applegate takes a young girl, grows her up, and gets her the lead in a Broadway show, planning to change her back, bankrupting all the investors. Book, music, and lyrics are by San Francisco Bay Area writer/lyricist/composer Ted Kopulos.

A contemporary film adaptation of the musical was announced in 2009, with [[Jim Carrey]] as Applegate and [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as Joe Hardy,<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Michael|url=https://variety.com/2009/film/features/carrey-gyllenhaal-do-yankees-1118000631/|title=Carrey, Gyllenhaal do ''Yankees''|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 26, 2009|access-date=February 28, 2009}}</ref> but the project failed to develop.
