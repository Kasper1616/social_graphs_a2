A '''skid row''', also called '''skid road''', is an impoverished area, typically urban, in English-speaking [[North America]] whose inhabitants are mostly poor people "[[wikt:on the skids|on the skids]]". This specifically refers to people who are poor or homeless, considered disreputable, downtrodden or forgotten by society.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Skid Row | journal=Collins English Dictionary – Complete & Unabridged | edition=2012 Digital | year=2012 | publisher=HarperCollins | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/skid%20row?s=t}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=skid road|date=2021-08-25|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=skid_road&oldid=63750283|work=Wiktionary|language=en|access-date=2022-01-21}}</ref> A skid row may be anything from an impoverished urban district to a [[red-light district]] to a gathering area for people experiencing homelessness or drug addiction. In general, skid row areas are inhabited or frequented by impoverished individuals and also people who are addicted to drugs. Urban areas considered skid rows are marked by high [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]], dilapidated buildings, and drug dens, as well as other features of [[urban blight]]. Used figuratively, the phrase may indicate the state of a poor person's life.

The term ''skid road'' originally referred to the path along which timber workers skidded logs.<ref name=AMHER1>{{cite web|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=skid+row&submit.x=0&submit.y=0|work=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition|title=Skid road|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|access-date=23 September 2015|quote=A squalid district inhabited chiefly by derelicts and vagrants.

The term "skid row" may often be interchangeable with the term [[tent city]].{{Cn|date=November 2024}} A tent city may exist on the premises of a skid row, but many tent cities are in areas not known as skid rows.

== Origins ==
The term "skid road" dates back to the 17th century, when it referred to a [[log road]], used to skid or drag logs through woods and bog.<ref name="NYTs">{{cite news|title=A Clash Over Aid Effort on the First 'Skid Row'|last=Turner|first=Wallace|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/02/us/a-clash-over-aid-effort-on-the-first-skid-row.html|newspaper=The [[New York Times]]|date=December 2, 1986|access-date=23 September 2015|page=A20}}</ref> The term was in common usage in the mid-19th century and came to refer not just to the [[corduroy road]]s themselves, but to logging camps and mills all along the [[Pacific Coast]].

== United States ==
=== Albuquerque ===
[[International District, Albuquerque, New Mexico]], specifically with some areas off [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Ave]], especially intersecting Louisiana, Texas, and Rhode Island Streets, have high homelessness rates, as well as a higher than average rate of public drug usage and high property-related crime and violence. The area is colloquially known as the "War Zone". Albuquerque had a rising murder rate in the early 2020s, with the murder rate surpassing 20 per 100,000 people, as well as a surge of visible homelessness especially in the ID area. In the 1990s, some years the neighborhood would account for over half the city's homicide count, despite being 1-2% of the city's population.

=== Anchorage ===
Fourth Street in [[Downtown Anchorage]] has a homelessness and drug abuse problem. In 1978, a descriptive analysis document compiled by a [[Department of Health]] facility in Anchorage, regarding downtown Anchorage's social issues and vagrancy described parts of Fourth Street as "Skid Row". Today, the name is not as used professionally, but still has issues of homelessness, especially affecting [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[Native Alaskans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.muni.org/Departments/health/Documents/Skid%20Row%20(Kelso)%20Report%204-1978.pdf|title=The Division of Social Services Department of Health and Social Services}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Treinen |first1=Lex |title=As Anchorage faces the pandemic and homelessness, resignations at the health department pile up |url=https://www.alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/as-anchorage-faces-the-pandemic-and-homeless-crisis-resignations-at-the-health-department-pile-up/ |work=Alaska Public Media |date=9 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211227144527/https://www.alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/as-anchorage-faces-the-pandemic-and-homeless-crisis-resignations-at-the-health-department-pile-up/ |archive-date=27 December 2021}}</ref> Forty-five percent of Anchorage's homeless population is Alaskan Native, as compared to less than 15% of Anchorage's population being of Alaskan descent. 1,100 Anchorage residents were homeless in 2019, over two percent of the city's population.

=== Chicago ===
Traditional Skid Row areas in [[Chicago]] were centered along West Madison Street just west of the [[Chicago River]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newcity.com/2010/08/11/bummed-out-how-skid-row-went-from--"the-land-of-the-living-dead"-to-cappuccinos-and-condos/|title=How Chicago's Skid Row Went From "The Land of the Living Dead" to Cappuccinos and Condos {{pipe}} Newcity|first=David|last=Witter|date=August 11, 2010}}</ref> and, to a lesser degree, North Clark Street just north of the Chicago River.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/cushman/results/detail.do?query=city%3A%22Chicago%22&page=14&pagesize=50&display=thumbcap&action=search&pnum=P04092|title=Charles W.

=== Denver ===
[[Union Station, Denver]], [[Colorado]] has a homelessness and vagrancy problem. Reports of public drug consumption, including that of [[opiates]] and [[meth]], are daily or regularly reported on the public train and buses, and the district is amongst the top 3 areas of highest violent crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kdvr.com/news/local/rtd-union-calls-denver-union-station-a-lawless-hellhole/|title=RTD union calls Denver Union Station a 'lawless hellhole'|publisher=[[KDVR]]|author=Whitley, Morgan|date=2 December 2021}}</ref> In July 2020, an estimated 1,350 people were camped out within Denver city limits, and an advocacy group for homeless individuals counted 664 tents.

===Honolulu===
[[Chinatown, Honolulu|Chinatown]] has had issues with blight of homelessness and poverty. Initially more predominately Chinese when it was established and active in the 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries, it became a [[red-light district]] after [[World War II]] era. Today, the neighborhood still experiences problems with people dealing with addiction and mental health problems, as well as homelessness and public crime.<ref name="bull98">{{cite news |title= Chinatown: A bike city waiting to be reborn |last=Wagner |first=Peter |date= September 29, 1998 |work= [[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/98/09/29/news/story3.html |access-date= 2010-04-09 }}</ref>

=== Houston ===
[[File:HoustonWards1920.jpg|thumb|<!--left-->right|1920 map of the [[six wards of Houston]]]] In the 1800s much of what was the [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]], the present day south side of Downtown Houston. According to some, the eastern boundary is a low rent group of houses near [[Texas Southern University]] referred to as "Sugar Hill". and among musicians, the Third Ward's boundaries are usually thought of as extending southward from the junction of [[Interstate 45]] (Gulf Freeway) and [[Interstate 69]]/[[U.S. Route 59]] (Southwest Freeway) to the Brays Bayou, with Main Street forming the western boundary. The Third Ward was what Stephen Fox, an architectural historian who lectured at Rice University, referred to as "the elite neighborhood of late 19th-century Houston". Ralph Bivins of the Houston Chronicle said that Fox said that area was "a silk-stocking neighborhood of Victorian-era homes". Bivins said that the construction of Union Station, which occurred around 1910, caused the "residential character" of the area to "deteriorate". Hotels opened in the area to service travelers. Afterwards, according to Bivins, the area "began a long downward slide toward the skid row of the 1990s" and the hotels were changed into flophouses. Passenger trains stopped going to Union Station. The City of Houston abolished the ward system in the early 1900s, but the name "Third Ward" was continued to be used to refer to the territory that it used to cover.<ref name="Wood72">Wood, Roger.

The Third Ward today, and parts of Downtown Houston area, struggle with drug issues, homelessness and poverty.

===Los Angeles===
{{Main article|Skid Row, Los Angeles}}[[File:Tenting in Los Angeles Skid Row.jpg|thumb|Tents of homeless people on the sidewalk in [[Skid Row, Los Angeles]]]]The Los Angeles Skid Row is an area on the East side of Downtown Los Angeles, roughly bounded by Los Angeles Street on the West, Central Avenue on the East, 4th Street on the North, and 8th Street on the South. The area was originally home to many cheap, low-quality hotels, popular with itinerant laborers and new arrivals to the city owing to its proximity to the train station and its central location.<ref>{{cite web|date=July 24, 2021|title=History of Downtown Los Angeles|url=http://www.lachamber.com/clientuploads/LUCH_committee/102208_History_of_Skid_Row.pdf|website=Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce}}</ref> In an attempt to rehabilitate the area in the 1960s, most of the run-down single-room occupancy hotels were demolished. This led to major reduction in the amount of very low-cost, bare minimum housing available to the area's extremely low-income population, contributing to the severe homelessness problem in the area. Skid Row was once located at the industrial periphery of Los Angeles' often neglected downtown area. As downtown has been revitalized since the 1990s and the adjacent Arts District area has gone from a desolate industrial wasteland to a major center for tourism, entertainment, and upscale housing development, Skid Row has become increasingly hemmed in by bustling, populated neighborhoods. This has contributed to a substantial increase in the density of homeless residents living on the streets in Skid Row, since many of the new residents and businesses in the surrounding areas do not want the encampments to spread.

Local [[Homelessness in the United States|homeless]] count estimates have ranged from 3,668 to 8,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abc7.com/society/las-homeless-aerial-tour-of-skid-row-epicenter-of-crisis/5344680/|title=LA's homeless: Aerial view tour of Skid Row, epicenter of crisis|last=Cristi|first=Chris|date=June 13, 2019|work=ABC7}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rats, trash and typhoid: Los Angeles' growing shantytown slum |url=https://www.news.com.au/news/rats-trash-and-typhoid-los-angeles-growing-shantytown-slum/news-story/fb65b420e775600e10171c7fc592fd2e |work=News.com.au |date=June 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2011, the homeless population estimate for Los Angeles' Skid Row was 4,316.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theycountwillyou.org/Docs/HC11-Detailed-Geography-Report-FINAL.PDF |title=2011 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count (page 38 – Skid Row section) |publisher=[[Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority]] |access-date=2011-11-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231143/http://www.theycountwillyou.org/Docs/HC11-Detailed-Geography-Report-FINAL.PDF |archive-date=2012-04-25 }}</ref> L.A.'s Skid Row is sometimes called "the Nickel", referring to a section of Fifth Street.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103214505 |title=For Some, L.A.'s Skid Row Is For Beginnings |newspaper=NPR |access-date=2009-09-21}}</ref>

Several of the city's homeless and social-service providers (such as [[Weingart Center Association]], [[Volunteers of America]], [[Frontline Foundation]], [[Midnight Mission]], [[Union Rescue Mission]] and [[Downtown Women's Center]]) are based in Skid Row.

Within Skid Row, the [[Los Angeles Poverty Department]] (LAPD) is a performance group whose members are mostly homeless or formerly homeless people who create performances and multimedia art that highlight connections between their lived experiences and external forces that impact their lives.

[[Westlake, Los Angeles|Westlake]] and [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]] have had issues with street crime and homelessness, and elements of skid rows and red-light districts.

=== Minneapolis ===
The twenty-five-block area that became known as the Gateway District in downtown [[Minneapolis]] was once the city's Skid Row. The area was a dense collection of bars, liquor stores, flop houses and rescue missions. Many on Skid Row were seasonal laborers who came from different parts of the country to work on farms or in lumber mills. During off-season months they crowded into the city, and onto Skid Row.

=== New York City ===
In [[New York City]], Skid Row was a nickname given to the [[Bowery]] during much of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jesse McKinley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/13/style/along-the-bowery-skid-row-is-on-the-skids.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Along the Bowery, Skid Row Is on the Skids |access-date=2010-04-06 | work=The New York Times | date=2002-10-13}}</ref>

Along East 125th Street in [[East Harlem, Manhattan]], there is a noticeable density of homelessness and drug use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patch.com/new-york/harlem/mayor-visits-east-harlem-blocks-troubled-drug-use|title=Mayor visits East Harlem blocks troubled by drug use|publisher=[[Patch.com]]|author=Garber, Nick|date=10 November 2020}}</ref> There are elements of a drug and poverty-related society along with homelessness in [[Lower Manhattan]]. 

New York City's climate is colder during the autumn and winter, thus more people experiencing homelessness are sheltered (less than 10% of people experiencing homelessness in the city are unsheltered), and elements of blight are usually less visible than that of west coast cities. As of 2019, 5% of NYC homeless people were unsheltered, compared to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]'s 67% being unsheltered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bay-Area-homeless-unsheltered-67-percent-NYC-13757259.php#:~:text=67%20percent%20of%20Bay%20Area%20homeless%20are%20unsheltered.,28%2C000%20people%20across%20the%20nine-county%20region%20lacking%20housing|title=67 percent of Bay Area homeless are unsheltered.

===Oakland area===
There are some facets of skid row in nearby [[Oakland, California]], especially on [[International Boulevard (Oakland, California)|International Boulevard]], where homelessness and prostitution has been problematic. There are scattered elements of skid row and [[tent cities]] in [[Downtown Oakland]] and [[East Oakland]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/us/24oakland.html?hpw|title = In Oakland, Redefining Sex Trade Workers as Abuse Victims|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 24 May 2011|last1 = Brown|first1 = Patricia Leigh}}</ref> [[People's Park, Berkeley]] has struggled with drug abuse and homelessness, with social services nearby. The area was a concentration of tents in Berkeley. Although the area is benign in comparison to major cities, it has a multi-decades-long history of homeless settlements.

=== Philadelphia ===
Philadelphia once had a highly visible skid row centered on Vine Street, just west of the approaches to the [[Benjamin Franklin Bridge]].

During the 1960s, when development interests and the Redevelopment Agency were using eminent domain to clear out a large area populated by retired men in the South of Market area, that area was termed "Skid Row" in the media. The city's convention center was built after the clearing of long term low-income residents.<ref>Hartman, Chester. 1984. The Transformation of San Francisco.

{{Main article|Downtown Eastside}}
[[File:DTES Alley Culture 02.jpg|thumb|[[Downtown Eastside]]]]
The 100-block of East Hastings Street in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the heart of that city's "skid road" neighborhood, lies on a historical skid road.<ref>[https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=8283 DESCRIPTION OF HISTORIC PLAC12 Hastings Street] Retrieved 17 September 2023</ref> The Vancouver Skid Road was part of a complex of such roads in the dense forests surrounding the [[Hastings Mill]] and adjacent to the settlement of Granville, Burrard Inlet ([[Gastown]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualvancouver.com/gastown.html|title=Gastown|publisher=Virtual Vancouver|access-date=2008-02-10|archive-date=2008-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209220612/http://www.virtualvancouver.com/gastown.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city began as a sawmill settlement called Granville, in the early 1870s.<ref name="AVan">{{cite web |url=http://vancouver.ca/aboutvan.htm|title=About Vancouver |publisher=City of Vancouver |year=2007 |access-date=2007-01-27}}</ref> By at least the 1950s, "Skid Road" was commonly used to describe the more dilapidated areas in the city's [[Downtown Eastside]],<ref>"Demolish City's Skid Road, Murder Protest Demands." Vancouver Sun. April 6, 1962. p. 1.</ref> which is focused on the original "strip" along East Hastings Street due to a concentration of [[single-room occupancy]] hotels (SROs) and associated drinking establishments in the area. The area's seedy origins date back to the early concentration of saloons in pre-Canadian Prohibition (1915–1919) and its popularity with loggers, miners and fishermen whose work was seasonal and who spent their salaries in the area's cheap accommodations and public houses.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Opium]] and [[heroin]] use became popular early on; Vancouver was for many years the main port-of-entry for the North American opium supply. During the Great Depression, the railway rights-of-way and other vacant lots in the area were thronged by the unemployed and poor, and the pattern of social decay became well-established. In the 1970s, the endemic alcohol and poverty problems in the area were exacerbated by the expansion of the drug trade, with [[crack cocaine]] becoming high-profile in the 1980s as well as a re-concentration of the prostitution trade in the area because of the relocation of hooker strolls in conjunction with city policy for [[Expo 86]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

A portion of Vancouver's Skid Row, [[Gastown]], has also been [[Gentrification|gentrified]]; however it is in a difficult coexistence with the nearby impoverished [[Downtown Eastside]] along East Hastings Street.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Downtown Eastside is deemed to be one of the poorest urban areas in [[Canada]].<ref name="Poorest">{{cite news |url=http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/909 |title=The Poorest Postal Code Vancouver's Downtown Eastside in Photos |last=Kalache |first=Stefan |publisher=The Dominion |date=January 12, 2007 |access-date=2007-10-15}}</ref> It is wedged between popular tourist destinations such as Downtown, [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Chinatown]] and Gastown. East Hastings Street is also a major thoroughfare. These avenues of exposure make the Downtown Eastside a highly visible example of a skid row.

The Downtown Eastside (sometimes abbreviated D.T.E.S.) is also home to [[Insite]], the first legal [[intravenous drug]] safe injection site in North America, part of a [[harm reduction]] policy aimed at helping the area's drug addicted residents. Additional sites have been established with approval from Health Canada in 2017 and 2018 as part of the strategy for dealing with the epidemic of lethal opioid (primarily [[fentanyl]]) overdoses.
