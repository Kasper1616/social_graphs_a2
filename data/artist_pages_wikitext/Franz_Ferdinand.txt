== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Franz Ferdinand was born in [[Graz]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]], the eldest son of [[Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria]] (the younger brother of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] and [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]]) and of his second wife, [[Princess Maria Annunziata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]]. In 1875, when he was eleven years old, his cousin [[Francis V, Duke of Modena]], died, naming Franz Ferdinand his heir on condition that he add the name "Este" to his own. This inheritance made Franz Ferdinand one of the wealthiest men in Austria.{{citation needed|date = January 2016}}

=== Heir presumptive ===
In 1889, Franz Ferdinand's life changed dramatically.  His cousin [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Crown Prince Rudolf]] committed suicide at his hunting lodge in [[Mayerling incident|Mayerling]].<ref name="brook">

=== Military career ===
Franz Ferdinand, like most males in the ruling [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg]] line, entered the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] at a young age.  He was frequently and rapidly promoted, given the rank of [[lieutenant]] at age fourteen, [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]] at twenty-two, [[colonel]] at twenty-seven, and [[major general]] at thirty-one.<ref name="Rothenburg, G. 1976. p 141">{{cite book|last=Rothenburg|first=G.|title=The Army of Francis Joseph|place=West Lafayette|publisher=Purdue University Press|date=1976|page=141}}</ref> While never receiving formal staff training, he was considered eligible for command and at one point briefly led the primarily Hungarian 9th [[Hussar]] Regiment.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=120}} In 1898 he was given a commission "at the special disposition of His Majesty" to make inquiries into all aspects of the military services and military agencies were commanded to share their papers with him.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=141}}

He also held honorary ranks in the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]], and received the rank of [[admiral]] at the close of the Austro-Hungarian naval maneuvers in September 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |title=Court News|date=5 September 1902 |page=7 |issue=36865}}</ref>

Franz Ferdinand exerted influence on the armed forces even when he did not hold a specific command through a military [[chancery (diplomacy)|chancery]] that produced and received documents and papers on military affairs. This was headed by {{ill|Alexander Brosch von Aarenau|de}} and eventually employed a staff of sixteen.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=141}} His authority was reinforced in 1907 when he secured the retirement of the Emperor's confidant [[Friedrich von Beck-Rzikowsky]] as Chief of the General Staff. Beck's successor, [[Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]], was personally selected by Franz Ferdinand.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=136}}

Franz in 1913, as heir-presumptive to the elderly emperor, had been appointed inspector general of all the armed forces of Austria-Hungary (''Generalinspektor der gesamten bewaffneten Macht''), a position superior to that previously held by [[Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Albrecht]] and including presumed command in wartime.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=170}}

=== Marriage and family ===
[[File:The Austro Hungarian Empire Before the First World War Q81810.jpg|thumb|upright|Archduke Franz Ferdinand with his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, and their three children (from left), Prince Ernst von Hohenberg, Princess Sophie, and Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg, in 1910]]
In 1894, Franz Ferdinand met Countess [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie Chotek]], a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Princess Isabella of Croy|Archduchess Isabella]], wife of [[Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen]].<ref name="Radziwill">{{cite book|first=Catherine|last=Radziwill|title=The Austrian Court From Within|url=https://archive.org/details/austriancourtfr00radzgoog|publisher=Cassel and Company, LTD|location=London|year=1916|isbn=1-4021-9370-X}}</ref> Franz began to visit Archduke Friedrich's villa in Pressburg (now [[Bratislava]]), and in turn Sophie wrote to Franz Ferdinand during his convalescence from [[tuberculosis]] on the island of [[Lošinj]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. They kept their relationship a secret,<ref name="Meyer2007"/> until it was discovered by Isabella.

To be eligible to marry a member of the imperial House of Habsburg, one had to be a member of one of the reigning or formerly reigning dynasties of Europe. The Choteks were not one of these families. Deeply in love, Franz Ferdinand refused to consider marrying anyone else. Finally, in 1899, Emperor Franz Joseph agreed to permit Franz Ferdinand to marry Sophie, provided that the marriage would be [[morganatic]] and that their descendants would not have succession rights to the throne.<ref name="brook"/><!-- pg. 126 --> Sophie would not share her husband's rank, title, [[Order of precedence|precedence]], or privileges, nor would she normally appear in public beside him. She would not be allowed to ride in the royal carriage or sit in the royal box in theaters.<ref name="Meyer2007">{{cite book |last=Meyer |first=G.

The wedding took place on 1 July 1900, at Reichstadt (now [[Zákupy]]) in [[Bohemia]]; Franz Joseph did not attend the ceremony, nor did Franz Ferdinand's brothers or any other archduke.<ref name="brook"/><!-- pg. 126 --> The only members of the imperial family present were Franz Ferdinand's stepmother, [[Infanta Maria Theresa of Portugal|Princess Maria Theresa of Braganza]], and her two daughters. Upon the marriage, Sophie was given the title "Princess of Hohenberg" ({{lang|de|Fürstin von Hohenberg}}) with the style "Her Serene Highness" ({{lang|de|Ihre Durchlaucht}}). In 1909, she was given the more senior title "Duchess of Hohenberg" ({{lang|de|Herzogin von Hohenberg}}) with the style "Her Highness" ({{lang|de|Ihre Hoheit}}). This raised her status considerably, but she was still required to yield precedence at court to all the archduchesses. Whenever a function required the couple to assemble with the other members of the imperial family, Sophie had to stand far down the line, separated from her husband.<ref name="Meyer2007"/>

Franz Ferdinand's children were:
* [[Princess Sophie of Hohenberg]] (1901–1990), married Count Friedrich von Nostitz-Rieneck (1891–1973)
* [[Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg]] (1902–1962), married Countess Elisabeth von Waldburg zu Wolfegg und Waldsee (1904–1993)
* [[Prince Ernst of Hohenberg]] (1904–1954), married Marie-Therese Wood (1910–1985)

Franz Ferdinand and Sophie visited England in the autumn of 1913, spending a week with [[George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] at [[Windsor Castle]] before going to stay for another week with the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] at [[Welbeck Abbey]], [[Nottinghamshire]], where they arrived on 22 November. He attended a service at the local Catholic church in [[Worksop]].  Franz Ferdinand and the Duke of Portland went game shooting on the Welbeck estate when, according to Portland's memoirs, ''Men, Women and Things'':

{{blockquote|One of the loaders fell down. This caused both barrels of the gun he was carrying to be discharged, the shot passing within a few feet of the archduke and myself.

On Sunday, 28 June 1914, at about 10:45 am, Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in [[Sarajevo]], the capital of the [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The perpetrator was 19-year-old [[Gavrilo Princip]], a member of [[Young Bosnia]] and one of a group of assassins organized and armed by the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]].<ref name="johnson" />

Earlier in the day, the couple had been attacked by [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]], also a Young Bosnia conspirator, who had thrown a grenade at their car. However, the bomb detonated behind them, injuring the occupants in the following car. On arriving at the Governor's residence, Franz asked "So you welcome your guests with bombs!"<ref name="beyer146">Beyer, Rick, ''The Greatest Stories Never Told'', Harper Collins, {{ISBN|978-0-06-001401-8}}. pp.&nbsp;146–147</ref>

After a short rest at the Governor's residence, the royal couple insisted on seeing all those who had been injured by the bomb at the local hospital. However, no one told the drivers that the itinerary had been changed. When the error was discovered, the drivers had to turn around. As the cars backed down the street and onto a side street, the line of cars stalled. At this time, Princip was sitting at a cafe across the street. He instantly seized his opportunity and walked across the street and shot the royal couple.<ref name="beyer146" /> He first shot Sophie in the abdomen and then shot Franz Ferdinand in the neck. Franz leaned over his crying wife. He was still alive when witnesses arrived to render aid.<ref name="johnson" /> His dying words to Sophie were, "Don't die darling, live for our children."<ref name="beyer146" /> Princip's weapon was the pocket-sized [[FN Model 1910]] pistol chambered for the [[.380 ACP]] cartridge provided him by Serbian Army [[Military Intelligence]] [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] and [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] leader [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]].<ref>

Whether or not as a result of this obstacle, his wound could not be attended to in time to save him, and he died within minutes. Sophie also died en route to the hospital.<ref>

<blockquote>
One bullet pierced Franz Ferdinand's neck while the other pierced Sophie's abdomen.&nbsp;... As the car was reversing (to go back to the Governor's residence because the entourage thought the Imperial couple were unhurt) a thin streak of blood shot from the Archduke's mouth onto Count Harrach's right cheek (he was standing on the car's running board). Harrach drew out a handkerchief to still the gushing blood. The Duchess, seeing this, called: "For Heaven's sake! What happened to you?" and sank from her seat, her face falling between her husband's knees.

Harrach and Potoriek&nbsp;... thought she had fainted&nbsp;... only her husband seemed to have an instinct for what was happening. Turning to his wife despite the bullet in his neck, Franz Ferdinand pleaded: "''Sopherl! Sopherl! Sterbe nicht! Bleibe am Leben für unsere Kinder!''&nbsp;– Sophie dear! Don't die! Stay alive for our children!" Having said this, he seemed to sag down himself. His plumed hat&nbsp;... fell off; many of its green feathers were found all over the car floor. Count Harrach seized the Archduke by the uniform collar to hold him up. He asked "''Leiden Eure Kaiserliche Hoheit sehr?''&nbsp;– Is Your Imperial Highness suffering very badly?"  "''Es ist nichts.''&nbsp;– It is nothing." said the Archduke in a weak but audible voice. He seemed to be losing consciousness during his last few minutes, but, his voice growing steadily weaker, he repeated the phrase perhaps six or seven times more.

A [[Death rattle|rattle]] began to issue from his throat, which subsided as the car drew in front of the Konak bersibin (Town Hall).
Despite several doctors' efforts, the Archduke died shortly after being carried into the building while his beloved wife was almost certainly dead from internal bleeding before the motorcade reached the Konak.
</blockquote>

The assassinations, along with the [[arms race]], [[nationalism]], [[imperialism]], [[militarism]] of [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] and the alliance system all contributed to the [[origins of World War I]], which began a month after Franz Ferdinand's death, with Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia.{{sfn|Johnson|1989|p=56}} The assassination of Franz Ferdinand is considered the most immediate cause of World War&nbsp;I.<ref>John McCannon.

{{blockquote|Francis Ferdinand was a prince of absolutist inclinations, but he had certain intellectual gifts and undoubted moral earnestness. One of his projects – though because of his impatient, suspicious, almost hysterical temperament, his commitment to it, and the methods by which he proposed to bring it about, often changed – was to consolidate the structure of the state and the authority and popularity of the Crown, on which he saw clearly that the fate of the dynasty depended, by abolishing, if not the dominance of the German Austrians, which he wished to maintain for military reasons, though he wanted to diminish it in the civil administration, certainly the far more burdensome sway of the Magyars over the Slav and Romanian nationalities which in 1848–49 had saved the dynasty in armed combat with the Hungarian revolution. Baron Margutti <small>([[:de:Albert von Margutti|de]])</small>, Francis Joseph's aide-de-camp, was told by Francis Ferdinand in 1895 and – with a remarkable consistency in view of the changes that took place in the intervening years – again in 1913, that the introduction of the dual system in 1867 had been disastrous and that, when he ascended the throne, he intended to re-establish strong central government: this objective, he believed, could be attained only by the simultaneous granting of far-reaching administrative autonomy to all the nationalities of the monarchy. In a letter of February 1, 1913, to [[Leopold Berchtold|Berchtold]], the Foreign Minister, in which he gave his reasons for not wanting war with Serbia, Franz Ferdinand said that "irredentism in our country&nbsp;... will cease immediately if our Slavs are given a comfortable, fair and good life" instead of being trampled on (as they were being trampled on by the Hungarians). It must have been this which caused Berchtold, in a character sketch of Francis Ferdinand written ten years after his death, to say that, if he had succeeded to the throne, he would have tried to replace the dual system by a supranational federation.<ref>Valiani, Leo, ''The End of Austria-Hungary'', Alfred A. Knopf, New York (1973) pp.&nbsp;9–10 [translation of: ''La Dissoluzione dell'Austria-Ungheria'', Casa Editrice Il Saggiatore, Milano (1966) pp.&nbsp;19–20]</ref>}}

After the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and Sophie in 1914, Marie Valerie, the daughter of Emperor Franz Joseph, observed that her father had placed more trust in the newly designated heir, his grandnephew Archduke Charles. The emperor confessed to his daughter about the assassination, stating: "For me, it is a relief from a great worry."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Palmer |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Palmer |year=1994 |title=Twilight of the Habsburgs: the Life and Times of Emperor Francis Joseph |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |isbn=978-1857998696|page=324}}</ref>

==Political views==
[[File:Greater austria.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the [[United States of Greater Austria|federalization of Austria-Hungary]] planned by Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the member states with separate governments]]

"The three cornerstones of Ferdinand's political conviction were clericalism, anti-democratic views, and anti-Hungarianism," and the basis of his worldview was that "politics is a matter only for the ruler, while the people, the masses have to obey." Franz Ferdinand often complained that in Hungary, the glorification of revolutionary hero [[Lajos Kossuth]], the decline of the monarchical principle, and the dominance of the Freemasons and the Jewish people was prevalent.<ref>Quote of historian László Gulyás (2019): The Assassination of Franz Ferdinand : The Archduke Who Despised Hungarians Url: [https://web.archive.org/web/20201216121124/https://hungarytoday.hu/the-assassination-of-franz-ferdinand-the-archduke-who-despised-hungarians/]</ref> Historians have disagreed on how to characterize the political philosophies of Franz Ferdinand, some attributing generally liberal views on the empire's nationalities while others have emphasized his dynastic centralism, Catholic conservatism, and tendency to clash with other leaders.<ref name="Rothenburg, G. 1976. p 141"/>

He advocated granting greater autonomy to ethnic groups within the Empire and addressing their grievances, especially the Czechs in [[Bohemia]] and the south Slavic peoples in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia]], who had been left out of the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]].<ref>

}}</ref> Yet his feelings towards the Hungarians were less generous, often described as antipathy. For example, in 1904 he wrote that "The Hungarians are all rabble, regardless of whether they are minister or duke, cardinal or burgher, peasant, hussar, domestic servant, or revolutionary", and he regarded even [[István Tisza]] as a revolutionary and "patented traitor".<ref name="Köpeczi">{{cite book |others=Béla Köpeczi (General Editor); Zoltán Szasz (Editor) | title = History of Transylvania | publisher = Akadémiai Kiadó | year = 1994 | location = Budapest |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/413.html| isbn = 963-05-6703-2}}</ref> He regarded [[Hungarian nationalism]] as a revolutionary threat to the Habsburg dynasty and reportedly became angry when officers of the 9th Hussars Regiment (which he commanded) spoke Hungarian in his presence&nbsp;– despite the fact that it was the official regimental language.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=120}} He further regarded the Hungarian branch of the Dual Monarchy's army, the [[Royal Hungarian Honvéd|Honvédség]], as an unreliable and potentially threatening force within the empire, complaining at the Hungarians' failure to provide funds for the joint army{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=147}} and opposing the formation of artillery units within the Hungarian forces.{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=133}}

He also advocated a cautious approach towards [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]&nbsp;– repeatedly locking horns with [[Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]], Vienna's hard-line Chief of the [[Austro-Hungarian General Staff]], warning that harsh treatment of Serbia would bring Austria-Hungary into open conflict with [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to the ruin of both empires.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

He was disappointed when Austria-Hungary failed to act as a great power, such as during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1900. Other nations, including, in his description, "dwarf states like Belgium and Portugal",{{sfn|Rothenburg|1976|p=136}} had soldiers stationed in China, but Austria-Hungary did not. However, Austria-Hungary did participate in the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] to suppress the Boxers, and sent soldiers as part of the "international relief force".

Franz Ferdinand was a prominent and influential supporter of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in a time when sea power was not a priority in Austrian foreign policy and the Navy was relatively little known or supported by the public. After his assassination in 1914, the Navy honoured Franz Ferdinand and his wife with a [[lying in state]] aboard [[SMS Viribus Unitis|SMS ''Viribus Unitis'']].
