==Mythology==
===Oath of the gods===
Styx was the oath of the gods. [[Homer]] calls Styx the "dread river of oath".<ref>''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.734-2.779 2.755].</ref> In both the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', it is said that swearing by the water of Styx is "the greatest and most dread oath for the blessed gods". Homer has [[Hera]] (in the ''Iliad'') say this when she swears by Styx to Zeus, that she is not to blame for Poseidon's intervention on the side of the Greeks in the [[Trojan War]], and he has [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] (in the ''Odyssey'') use the same words when she swears by Styx to [[Odysseus]] that she will cease to plot against him. Also [[Hypnos]] (in the ''Iliad'') makes Hera swear to him "by the inviolable water of Styx".<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:15.34-15.77 15.36&ndash;42] (Hera to Zeus), [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:14.270-14.311 14.271&ndash;278] (Hera to Hypnos), ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:5.145-5.191 5.184&ndash;187] (Calypso to Odysseus). Gantz, p. 29, calls such oaths in Homer "not overly common", noting that for Zeus, at least, a nod of his head was sufficient, with Zeus once calling such a nod the most sure witness, see ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.493-1.530 1.524&ndash;527].</ref>

Examples of oaths sworn by Styx also occur in the ''[[Homeric Hymns]]''.<ref>Gantz, p. 29.</ref> Demeter asks the "implacable" water of Styx to be her witness, as she swears to [[Metaneira]],<ref>''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn]]'' 2 ''to Demeter'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/homeric_hymns_2_demeter/2003/pb_LCL496.53.xml 259].</ref> [[Leto]] swears to the personified [[Delos]] by the water of Styx, calling it the "most powerful and dreadful oath that the blessed gods can swear",<ref>''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn]]'' 3 ''to Apollo'', [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/homeric_hymns_3_apollo/2003/pb_LCL496.77.xml 83&ndash;86].</ref> while [[Apollo]] asks [[Hermes]] to swear to him on the "dread" water of Styx.<ref>''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn]]'' 4 ''to Hermes'', [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/homeric_hymns_4_hermes/2003/pb_LCL496.155.xml 518&ndash;520].</ref>

[[Hesiod]], in the ''[[Theogony]]'', gives an account of how this role for Styx came about. He says that, during the [[Titanomachy]], the great war of Zeus and his fellow Olympians against Cronus and his fellow Titans, Zeus summoned "all the deathless gods to great Olympus" and promised, to whosoever would join him against the Titans, that he would preserve whatever rights and offices each had, or if they had none under Cronus, they would be given both under his rule. Styx, upon the advice of her father Oceanus, was the first to side with Zeus, bringing her children by Pallas along with her. And so in return Zeus appointed Styx to be "the great oath of the gods, and her children to live with him always."<ref>Gantz, pp. 29, 45; [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:371-403 389&ndash;402]. Compare with [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.2.5 1.2.5]. West 1966, p. 272, points out that this story of Styx being the first to come to Zeus' aid, by bringing her children, including Nike (Victory) and Kratos (Strength), to Zeus' side, is an aetiological myth explaining both why the gods swear by Styx, and why Victory and Strength reside for evermore with Zeus. West suggests that this myth can be imagined as having come about thought the following though process. "Why do the gods swear by Styx? Because Zeus so ordained. Why did he do so? In reward for some service performed for him by Styx. In what connexion? Most likely in connexion with the Titanomachy, for that was when Zeus most needed help. Then did she fight for him? Hardly in person: but she might have sent her children to fight for him. Then who can they have been, that he needed there help? Why, Victory and Strength; those were the gods he needed."</ref>

According to Hesiod, Styx lived at the entrance to Hades, in a cave "propped up to heaven all round with silver pillars".<ref>Tripp, s.v. Styx; Smith, [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0104%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DS%3Aentry+group%3D28%3Aentry%3Dstyx-bio-1 s.v. Styx]; [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:767-806 775&ndash;779].</ref> Hesiod also tells us that Zeus would send [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], the messenger of the gods, to fetch the "famous cold water" of Styx for the gods to swear by,<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:767-806 780&ndash;786]. Gantz, p. 29 calls this description of the oath as "rather strange", noting that elsewhere simply invoking Styx suffices.</ref> and describes the punishments which would follow the breaking of such an oath:<ref>Although Hesiod does provide consequences for the breaking of such an oath, Gantz, p. 29, says that "one might have thought it unbreakable".</ref>
{{blockquote|For whoever of the deathless gods that hold the peaks of snowy Olympus pours a libation of her water and is forsworn, must lie breathless until a full year is completed, and never come near to taste ambrosia and nectar, but lie spiritless and voiceless on a strewn bed: and a heavy trance overshadows him. But when he has spent a long year in his sickness, another penance more hard follows after the first. For nine years he is cut off from the eternal gods and never joins their councils or their feasts, nine full years. But in the tenth year he comes again to join the assemblies of the deathless gods who live in the house of Olympus.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:767-806 793&ndash;804].</ref>}}

The Roman poet [[Ovid]] has [[Jove]] (the Roman equivalent of Zeus) swear by the waters of Styx when he promises [[Semele]]:
{{poemquote|Whatever thy wish, it shall not be denied,
and that thy heart shall suffer no distrust,
I pledge me by that Deity, the Waves
of the deep Stygian Lake,—oath of the Gods.<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng1:3.251-3.313 3.308&ndash;312].</ref>}}
and was then obliged to follow through even though he realized to his horror that Semele's request would lead to her death.<ref>Compare with [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [https://topostext.org/work/206#179 179]; [[Nonnus]], ''[[Dionysiaca]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/nonnos-dionysiaca/1940/pb_LCL344.285.xml 8.178&ndash;406], which relate the same story of Semele's death, though with no mention of Zeus having sworn to grant anything Semele wished for.</ref> Similarly [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]] (the Roman equivalent of the Greek [[Helios]]) promised his son [[Phaethon]] whatever he desired, which also resulted in the boy's death after he asked to drive his father's chariot for a day.<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi006.perseus-eng1:2.1-2.102 2.42&ndash;46].</ref>

===River===
The goddess Styx, like her father Oceanus, and his sons the [[River gods (Greek mythology)|river gods]], was also a river, in her case, a river of the Underworld. According to Hesiod, Styx was given one-tenth of her father's water, which flowed far underground, and came up to the surface to pour out from a high rock: 
{{blockquote|the famous cold water ... trickles down from a high and beetling rock. Far under the wide-pathed earth a branch of Oceanus flows through the dark night out of the holy stream, and a tenth part of his water is allotted to her.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:767-806 785&ndash;789].</ref>}}

In the ''Iliad'' the river Styx forms a boundary of Hades, the abode of the dead, in the Underworld.<ref>Gantz, pp. 124&ndash;125; Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA109 p. 109].</ref> [[Athena]] mentions the "sheer-falling waters of Styx" needing to be crossed when Heracles returned from Hades after capturing [[Cerberus]],<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:8.335-8.380 8.366&ndash;369].</ref> and [[Patroclus]]'s shade begs Achilles to bury his corpse quickly so that he might "pass within the gates of Hades" and join the other dead "beyond the River".<ref>[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:23.54-23.92 23.71&ndash;74].</ref> So too in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', where the Styx winds nine times around the borders of Hades, and the boatman [[Charon]] is in charge of ferrying the dead across it.<ref>Tripp, s.v.

==The Arcadian Styx==
Styx, along with the underworld rivers [[Cocytus]] and [[Acheron]], were associated with waterways in the upper world.<ref>Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA110 p. 110].</ref> For example, according to Homer, the river [[Titarisios|Titaressus]], a tributary of the river [[Pineios (Thessaly)|Peneius]] in [[Thessaly]], was a branch of the Styx.<ref>Tripp, s.v. Styx; [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.734-2.779 2.751&ndash;755]; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:8.18.2 8.18.2]; [[Strabo]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-eng1:7.fragments.15 7 fr. 15].</ref> However Styx has been most commonly associated with an Arcadian stream and waterfall (the [[Mavroneri|Mavronéri]]) that runs through a ravine on the North face of mount [[Chelmos]] and flows into the [[Krathis]] river.<ref>Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA110 p. 110]; Grimal, s.v. Styx; Herodotus, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng1:6.74 6.74 n.1]; [[James George Frazer|Frazer]] on Pausanias [https://archive.org/details/pausaniassdescr01pausgoog/page/n272/mode/2up?view=theater 8.17.6] (which gives a detailed description of Frazer's visit to the fall of the Styx in 1895).</ref> The fifth-century BC historian [[Herodotus]], locates this stream&mdash;calling it "the water of Styx"&mdash;as being near [[Nonacris]] a town (in what was then ancient [[Arcadia (region)|Arcadia]] and now modern [[Achaea]]) not far from [[Pheneus]], and says that the [[Sparta]]n king [[Cleomenes I|Cleomenes]], would make men take oaths swearing by its water. Herodotus describes it as "a stream of small appearance, dropping from a cliff into a pool; a wall of stones runs round the pool".<ref>Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA110 p. 110]; [[Herodotus]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng1:6.74 6.74]. See also [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.393.xml 31.26]; [[Plutarch]], ''Alexander'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243%3Achapter%3D77%3Asection%3D2 77.2].</ref> Pausanias reports visiting the "water of the Styx" near Nonacris (which at the time of his visit, in the second century AD, was already a partially-buried ruins), saying that:

{{blockquote|Not far from the ruins is a high cliff; I know of none other that rises to so great a height. A water trickles down the cliff, called by the Greeks the water of the Styx.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:8.17.6 8.17.6].</ref>}}

According to [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], [[Demeter]] caused the water of this Arcadian Styx "to well up in the neighbourhood of Pheneus".<ref>[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''[[De Natura Animalium]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aelian-characteristics_animals/1958/pb_LCL448.335.xml 10.40].</ref> An ancient legend apparently also connected Demeter with this Styx. According to [[Photius I of Constantinople|Photius]], a certain Ptolemy Hephaestion (probably referring to [[Ptolemy Chennus]]) knew of a story, "concerning the water of the Styx in Arcadia", which told how an angry Demeter had turned the Styx's water black.<ref>[[Photius I of Constantinople|Photius]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' [https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/photius_copyright/photius_05bibliotheca.htm#190 codex 190].</ref> According to [[James George Frazer]], this "fable" provided an explanation for the fact that, from a distance, the waterfall appears black.<ref>[[James George Frazer|Frazer]] on Pausanias [https://archive.org/details/pausaniassdescr01pausgoog/page/n272/mode/2up?view=theater 8.17.6]. Frazer says that, although the water of this Styx is "crystal clear", its black appearance is due to a "dark incrustation which spreads over the smooth face of the rock wherever it is washed by the falling water".</ref>

Water from this Styx was said to be poisonous and able to dissolve most substances.<ref>Grimal, s.v. Styx.</ref> The first-century [[natural philosopher]] [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], wrote that drinking its water caused immediate death,<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL330.359.xml 2.231], [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.393.xml 31.26&ndash;27].</ref> and that the hoof of a female mule was the only material not "rotted" by its water.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.373.xml 30.149]. Compare with [[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis of Alexander]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/arrian-anabasis_alexander/1976/pb_LCL269.295.xml 7.27].</ref> According to [[Plutarch]] the poisonous water could only be held by an ass's hoof, since all other vessels would "be eaten through by it, owing to its coldness and pungency."<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''Alexander'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243%3Achapter%3D77%3Asection%3D2 77.2].</ref> While according to Pausanias, the only vessel that could hold the Styx's water (poisonous to both men and animals) was a horse's hoof.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:8.17.6 8.17.6], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:8.18.4 8.18.4&ndash;6], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:8.19.3 8.19.3]. Compare with [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]]'', [[De Natura Animalium]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aelian-characteristics_animals/1958/pb_LCL448.335.xml 10.40].</ref> There were ancient suspicions that Alexander the Great's death was caused by being poisoned with the water of this Styx.<ref>Mayor, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=igrUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA54 54], [https://books.google.com/books?id=igrUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA57 57&ndash;58]. As [[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis of Alexander]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/arrian-anabasis_alexander/1976/pb_LCL269.295.xml 7.27], and [[Plutarch]], ''Alexander'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243%3Achapter%3D77%3Asection%3D2 77.2] tell us, there were some who claimed that [[Aristotle]] had provided the poisonous water. See, for example, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL418.373.xml 30.149], which also claims that Aristotle had "discovered" the poisonous nature of the water of Styx.</ref>

The Arcadian Styx may have been named so after its mythological counterpart, but it is also possible that this Arcadian stream was the model for the mythological Styx.<ref>See for example Reclus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Es0LAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA230 p. 230], who, when describing this Arcadian Styx, assumes the latter saying: "out of this sometimes sombre and sometimes gracious torrent, the ancients made the muddy Styx of the lower world, whose murky floods were forever stirred by the fatal ferryman, Charon". However according to Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA110 p. 110], "There is no way of telling whether the traditional conception of the infernal river was influenced by knowledge of the Arcadian Styx and its falls, or whether, conversely, the Arcadian Styx was first given that name because its chilly falls resembled this of the Styx in Hesiod's description".</ref> The latter seems to be the case, at least, for the Styx in [[Apuleius]]'s ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'', which has [[Venus]], addressing [[Psyche (mythology)|Psyche]], give the following description:<ref>[[James George Frazer|Frazer]] on Pausanias [https://archive.org/details/pausaniassdescr01pausgoog/page/n272/mode/2up?view=theater 8.17.6].</ref>
{{blockquote|Do you see that steep mountain-peak standing above the towering cliff? Dark waves flow down from a black spring on that peak and are enclosed by the reservoir formed by the valley nearby, to water the swamps of Styx and feed the rasping currents of Cocytus.<ref>[[Apuleius]], ''[[The Golden Ass|Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/apuleius-metamorphoses/1989/pb_LCL044.277.xml 6.13].</ref>}}
That Apuleius has his "black spring" being guarded by dragons, also suggests a connection between his Styx and two modern local names for the waterfall: the Black Water (''Mavro Nero'') and the Dragon Water (''Drako Nero'').<ref>[[James George Frazer|Frazer]] on Pausanias [https://archive.org/details/pausaniassdescr01pausgoog/page/n272/mode/2up?view=theater 8.17.6]; Reclus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Es0LAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA230 p. 230]. From the "fable" of Demeter turning the Styx black, and Apuleius's description, Frazer concludes that the names Black Water and Dragon Water, probably predate Styx as the name of the fall.</ref>

==Moon==
