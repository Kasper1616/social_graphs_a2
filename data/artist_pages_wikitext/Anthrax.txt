== Etymology ==
The English name comes from ''anthrax'' ({{lang|grc|ἄνθραξ}}), the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for coal,<ref>{{LSJ|a)/nqrac|ἄνθραξ|ref}}.</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|anthrax}}</ref> possibly having [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] etymology,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV3dCQAAQBAJ|title=Wool Economy in the Ancient Near East | vauthors = Breniquet C, Michel C |year=2014|publisher=Oxbow Books|via=Google Books|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827170707/https://books.google.com/books?id=fV3dCQAAQBAJ|archive-date=27 August 2016|isbn=9781782976349}}</ref> because of the characteristic black skin [[lesion]]s people with a cutaneous anthrax infection develop. The central black [[eschar]] surrounded by vivid red skin has long been recognised as typical of the disease. The first recorded use of the word "anthrax" in English is in a 1398 translation of [[Bartholomaeus Anglicus]]'s work ''{{lang|la|De proprietatibus rerum}}'' (''On the Properties of Things'', 1240).<ref name="de Trevisa 1398">{{cite book| vauthors = de Trevisa J |title=Bartholomaeus Anglicus' De Proprietatibus Rerum|date=1398}}</ref>

Anthrax was historically known by a wide variety of names, indicating its symptoms, location, and groups considered most vulnerable to infection. They include Siberian plague, [[Cumberland County, New South Wales|Cumberland disease]], charbon, splenic fever, malignant edema, woolsorter's disease and ''{{lang|fr|[[Bradford|la maladie de Bradford]]}}''.<ref name="Stark 2013">{{cite book| vauthors = Stark J |title=The Making of Modern Anthrax, 1875–1920: Uniting Local, National and Global Histories of Disease|date=2013|publisher=Pickering & Chatto|location=London}}</ref>

== Signs and symptoms ==
=== Skin ===
[[Image:Skin reaction to anthrax.jpg|thumb|Skin lesion from anthrax]]

[[File:Riehl Zumbusch Tafel IV (2).jpg|thumb|Anthrax skin lesion on the face]]
Cutaneous anthrax, also known as hide-porter's disease, is when anthrax occurs on the skin. It is the most common (>90% of cases) and least dangerous form (low mortality with treatment, 23.7% mortality without).<ref>{{cite web|title=Cutaneous Anthrax|url=https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/types/cutaneous.html|website=CDC|access-date=16 February 2018|language=en-us|date=21 July 2014|archive-date=21 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121184541/https://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/types/cutaneous.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=Hend2014/> Cutaneous anthrax presents as a [[boil]]-like [[skin lesion]] that eventually forms an [[ulcer]] with a black center ([[eschar]]). The black eschar often shows up as a large, painless, [[necrotic]] ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, (somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration two to five days after exposure. Unlike [[bruise]]s or most other lesions, cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen, and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a few weeks. Complete recovery may take longer.<ref name="CDC-Anthrax">{{cite web|title=Anthrax Q & A: Signs and Symptoms |work=Emergency Preparedness and Response |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |year=2003 |url=http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/signs.asp |access-date=19 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405150014/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/faq/signs.asp |archive-date=5 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when ''B. anthracis'' spores enter through cuts on the skin.

Over the next day or so, shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain become more common, and complaints not involving the chest such as nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, sweats, and headache develop in one-third or more of people.<ref name="Yellow2020" /><!-- <ref name=Yellow2020/> --> Upper respiratory tract symptoms occur in only a quarter of people, and muscle pains are rare.<ref name="Yellow2020" /><!-- <ref name=Yellow2020/> --> Altered mental status or shortness of breath generally brings people to healthcare and marks the fulminant phase of illness.<!-- <ref name=Yellow2020/> --><ref name="Yellow2020" />

It infects the lymph nodes in the chest first, rather than the lungs themselves, a condition called hemorrhagic [[mediastinitis]], causing bloody fluid to accumulate in the chest cavity, thereby causing shortness of breath. The second (pneumonia) stage occurs when the infection spreads from the lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms of the second stage develop suddenly within hours or days after the first stage. Symptoms include high fever, extreme shortness of breath, shock, and rapid death within 48 hours in fatal cases.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url = http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%207th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202011.pdf|title = USAMRIID's Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook|last = [[USAMRIID]]|date = 2011|isbn = 9780160900150|edition = 7th|publisher = [[US Government Printing Office]]|quote = For the attacks of 2001, CFR was only 45%, while before this time CFRs for IA were >85% (p. 37)|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209044622/http://www.usamriid.army.mil/education/bluebookpdf/USAMRIID%20BlueBook%207th%20Edition%20-%20Sep%202011.pdf|archive-date = 9 February 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Herbivores are often infected while grazing, especially when eating rough, irritant, or spiky vegetation; the vegetation has been hypothesized to cause wounds within the gastrointestinal tract, permitting entry of the bacterial spores into the tissues. Once ingested or placed in an open wound, the bacteria begin multiplying inside the animal or human and typically kill the host within a few days or weeks. The spores germinate at the site of entry into the tissues and then spread by the circulation to the lymphatics, where the bacteria multiply.<ref name="Widdicombe">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes R, May AJ, Widdicombe JG | title = The role of the lymphatic system in the pathogenesis of anthrax | journal = British Journal of Experimental Pathology | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 343–49 | date = August 1956 | pmid = 13364144 | pmc = 2082573 }}</ref>

The production of two powerful exotoxins and lethal toxin by the bacteria causes death. Veterinarians can often tell a possible anthrax-induced death by its sudden occurrence and the dark, nonclotting blood that oozes from the body orifices.

The infection of herbivores (and occasionally humans) by inhalation normally begins with inhaled spores being transported through the air passages into the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The spores are then picked up by scavenger cells ([[macrophage]]s) in the lungs and transported through small vessels ([[lymphatic system|lymphatics]]) to the [[lymph nodes]] in the central chest cavity ([[mediastinum]]). Damage caused by the anthrax spores and bacilli to the central chest cavity can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing. Once in the lymph nodes, the spores germinate into active bacilli that multiply and eventually burst the macrophages, releasing many more bacilli into the bloodstream to be transferred to the entire body. Once in the bloodstream, these bacilli release three proteins: [[Anthrax lethal factor endopeptidase|lethal factor]], edema factor, and protective antigen. The three are not toxic by themselves, but their combination is incredibly lethal to humans.<ref name=Pimental04>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pimental RA, Christensen KA, Krantz BA, Collier RJ | title = Anthrax toxin complexes: heptameric protective antigen can bind lethal factor and edema factor simultaneously | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 322 | issue = 1 | pages = 258–62 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15313199 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.07.105 }}</ref> Protective antigen combines with these other two factors to form lethal toxin and edema toxin, respectively.

=== Exposure and transmission ===
Anthrax can enter the human body through the intestines (gastrointestinal), lungs (pulmonary), or skin (cutaneous), and causes distinct clinical symptoms based on its site of entry.<ref name=":5" /> Anthrax does not usually spread from an infected human to an uninfected human.<ref name=":5" /> If the disease is fatal to the person's body, its mass of anthrax bacilli becomes a potential source of infection to others and special precautions should be used to prevent further contamination.<ref name=":5" /> Pulmonary anthrax, if left untreated, is almost always fatal.<ref name=":5" /> Historically, pulmonary anthrax was called woolsorters' disease because it was an occupational hazard for [[Wool classing|people who sorted wool]].<ref name=":6">{{cite journal | vauthors = Metcalfe N | title = The history of woolsorters' disease: a Yorkshire beginning with an international future? | journal = Occupational Medicine | volume = 54 | issue = 7 | pages = 489–93 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15486181 | doi = 10.1093/occmed/kqh115 }}</ref> Today, this form of infection is extremely rare in industrialized nations.<ref name=":6" /> Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of transmission but also the least dangerous of the three transmissions.<ref name=":4" /> Gastrointestinal anthrax is likely fatal if left untreated, but very rare.<ref name=":4" />[[File:Anthrax - inhalational.jpg|thumb|Inhalational anthrax, [[mediastinum|mediastinal]] widening]]The spores of anthrax are able to survive in harsh conditions for decades or even centuries.<ref>{{Cite web | vauthors = Bloomfield R |date=2012-04-12 |title=Crossrail work stopped after human bones found on site |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/hp/front/crossrail-work-stopped-after-human-bones-found-on-site-6759649.html |access-date=2023-11-02 |website=Evening Standard |language=en |archive-date=25 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231025123650/https://www.standard.co.uk/hp/front/crossrail-work-stopped-after-human-bones-found-on-site-6759649.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Such spores can be found on all continents, including Antarctica.<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Hudson JA, Daniel RM, Morgan HW |title=Acidophilic and thermophilic Bacillus strains from geothermally heated antarctic soil |journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters |volume=60 |issue=3 |date=August 1989 |pages=279–82 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.1989.tb03486.x |doi-access=free }}</ref> Disturbed grave sites of infected animals have been known to cause infection after 70 years.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Guillemin J |url=http://archive.org/details/anthraxinvestiga0000guil |title=Anthrax : the investigation of a deadly outbreak |date=1999 |publisher=Berkeley : University of California Press |others=Internet Archive |isbn=978-0-520-22204-5}}</ref> In one such event, a young boy died from gastrointestinal anthrax due to the thawing of reindeer corpses from 75 years before contact.<ref name=":7">{{Cite magazine | vauthors = Luhn A |date=August 8, 2016 |title=Siberian Child Dies After Climate Change Thaws an Anthrax-Infected Reindeer |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/child-dead-climate-change-thawed-anthrax-infected-reindeer/ |access-date=2023-11-02 |magazine=Wired |language=en-US |issn=1059-1028 |archive-date=17 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817043745/http://www.wired.com/2016/08/child-dead-climate-change-thawed-anthrax-infected-reindeer/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Anthrax spores traveled through groundwater used for drinking and caused tens of people to be hospitalized, largely children.<ref name=":7" /> Occupational exposure to infected animals or their products (such as skin, wool, and meat) is the usual pathway of exposure for humans.<ref name=":8">{{Citation |title=Anthrax in humans |date=2008 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310487/ |work=Anthrax in Humans and Animals|edition=4th |access-date=2023-11-02 |publisher=World Health Organization |language=en |archive-date=18 June 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220618172116/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310487/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Workers exposed to dead animals and animal products are at the highest risk, especially in countries where anthrax is more common.<ref name=":8" /> Anthrax in [[livestock]] grazing on open range where they mix with wild animals still occasionally occurs in the U.S. and elsewhere.<ref name=":8" />

== Mechanism ==
The lethality of the anthrax disease is due to the bacterium's two principal virulence factors: the [[polyglutamic acid|poly-D-glutamic acid capsule]], which protects the bacterium from phagocytosis by host neutrophils; and the tripartite protein toxin, called [[anthrax toxin]], consisting of protective [[antigen]] (PA), [[edema]] factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF).<ref name=toxin>{{cite web |url=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/anthrax/ |title=Molecular Basis for Anthrax Intoxication | vauthors = Gao M |date=27 April 2006 |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |access-date=26 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226202812/http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/anthrax/ |archive-date=26 December 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> PA plus LF produces lethal toxin, and PA plus EF produces edema toxin. These toxins cause death and tissue swelling ([[edema]]), respectively.
To enter the cells, the edema and lethal factors use another protein produced by ''B. anthracis'' called protective antigen, which binds to two surface receptors on the host cell. A cell [[protease]] then cleaves PA into two fragments: PA<sub>20</sub> and PA<sub>63</sub>. PA<sub>20</sub> dissociates into the extracellular medium, playing no further role in the toxic cycle. PA<sub>63</sub> then oligomerizes with six other PA<sub>63</sub> fragments forming a heptameric ring-shaped structure named a prepore. Once in this shape, the complex can competitively bind up to three EFs or LFs, forming a resistant complex.<ref name="Pimental04"/> Receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs next, providing the newly formed toxic complex access to the interior of the host cell. The acidified environment within the endosome triggers the heptamer to release the LF and/or EF into the cytosol.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chvyrkova I, Zhang XC, Terzyan S | title = Lethal factor of anthrax toxin binds monomeric form of protective antigen | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 360 | issue = 3 | pages = 690–95 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17617379 | pmc = 1986636 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.06.124 }}</ref> It is unknown how exactly the complex results in the death of the cell.

Edema factor is a [[calmodulin]]-dependent [[adenylate cyclase]]. Adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP into [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) and [[pyrophosphate]]. The complexation of adenylate cyclase with [[calmodulin]] removes calmodulin from stimulating calcium-triggered signaling, thus inhibiting the immune response.<ref name="Pimental04"/> To be specific, LF inactivates [[neutrophil]]s (a type of phagocytic cell) by the process just described so they cannot phagocytose bacteria. Throughout history, lethal factor was presumed to cause macrophages to make [[TNF-alpha]] and [[IL1B|interleukin 1 beta]] (IL1B). TNF-alpha is a [[cytokine]] whose primary role is to regulate immune cells, as well as to induce inflammation and [[apoptosis]] or programmed cell death. Interleukin 1 beta is another cytokine that also regulates inflammation and apoptosis. The overproduction of TNF-alpha and IL1B ultimately leads to [[septic shock]] and death. However, recent evidence indicates anthrax also targets endothelial cells that line serious cavities such as the [[pericardial cavity]], [[pleural cavity]], and [[peritoneal cavity]], lymph vessels, and blood vessels, causing vascular leakage of fluid and cells, and ultimately [[hypovolemic shock]] and septic shock.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Septicaemic anthrax in a drug user.png|left|thumb|218x218px|Possible edema and necrosis in a case of injection anthrax.]]
Various techniques may be used for the direct identification of ''B. anthracis'' in clinical material. Firstly, specimens may be [[Gram stain]]ed. ''Bacillus'' spp. are quite large in size (3 to 4&nbsp;μm long), they may grow in long chains, and they stain Gram-positive. To confirm the organism is ''B. anthracis'', rapid diagnostic techniques such as [[polymerase chain reaction]]-based assays and [[Immunofluorescence|immunofluorescence microscopy]] may be used.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Levinson W |title=Review of Medical Microbiology and Immunology |year=2010 |edition=11th}}</ref>

All ''Bacillus'' species grow well on 5% sheep blood agar and other routine culture media. Polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate can be used to isolate ''B. anthracis'' from contaminated specimens, and bicarbonate agar is used as an identification method to induce capsule formation. ''Bacillus'' spp. usually grow within 24 hours of incubation at 35&nbsp;°C, in ambient air (room temperature) or in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. If bicarbonate agar is used for identification, then the medium must be incubated in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. ''B. anthracis'' colonies are medium-large, gray, flat, and irregular with swirling projections, often referred to as having a "[[Medusa|medusa head]]" appearance, and are not hemolytic on 5% sheep blood agar. The bacteria are not motile, susceptible to penicillin, and produce a wide zone of lecithinase on egg yolk agar. Confirmatory testing to identify ''B. anthracis'' includes gamma bacteriophage testing, indirect hemagglutination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Forbes BA |title=Bailey & Scott's Diagnostic Microbiology |year=2002 |edition=11th}}</ref> The best confirmatory precipitation test for anthrax is the [[Alberto Ascoli|Ascoli]] test.

== Prevention ==
Precautions are taken to avoid contact with the skin and any fluids exuded through natural body openings of a deceased body that is suspected of harboring anthrax.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/emergencypreparedness/anthrax/controlandprevention.html|title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Anthrax – Control and Prevention {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=22 December 2019|archive-date=22 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191222225809/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/emergencypreparedness/anthrax/controlandprevention.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The body should be put in strict quarantine. A blood sample is collected and sealed in a container and analyzed in an approved laboratory to ascertain if anthrax is the cause of death. The body should be sealed in an airtight body bag and incinerated to prevent the transmission of anthrax spores. Microscopic visualization of the encapsulated bacilli, usually in very large numbers, in a blood smear stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFadyean stain) is fully diagnostic, though the culture of the organism is still the gold standard for diagnosis. Full isolation of the body is important to prevent possible contamination of others.<ref name=":1" />

Protective, impermeable clothing and equipment such as [[rubber glove]]s, rubber apron, and rubber boots with no perforations are used when handling the body. No skin, especially if it has any wounds or scratches, should be exposed. Disposable personal protective equipment is preferable, but if not available, decontamination can be achieved by autoclaving. Used disposable equipment is burned and/or buried after use. All contaminated bedding or clothing is isolated in double plastic bags and treated as biohazard waste.<ref name=":1" /> Respiratory equipment capable of filtering small particles, such the US [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]- and [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]]-approved high-efficiency respirator, is worn.<ref>{{cite web | work = National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/default.html | title = Respirators | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170731101026/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/default.html | archive-date=31 July 2017 | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health | date = 30 April 2009 }}</ref> Addressing Anthrax from a [[One Health]] perspective reduces risks of transmission and better protects both human and animal populations.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=World Health Organization |url=https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/325620 |title=Taking a multisectoral, one health approach: a tripartite guide to addressing zoonotic diseases in countries |author2=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |author3=World Organisation for Animal Health |date=2019 |publisher=IRIS  |isbn=978-92-4-151493-4 |language=en |access-date=8 October 2023 |archive-date=14 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231014150959/https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/325620 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Antibiotics ===
Preventive antibiotics are recommended in those who have been exposed.<ref name=Hend2014/> Early detection of sources of anthrax infection can allow preventive measures to be taken. In response to the [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax attacks of October 2001]], the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) installed biodetection systems (BDSs) in their large-scale mail processing facilities. BDS response plans were formulated by the USPS in conjunction with local responders including fire, police, hospitals, and public health. Employees of these facilities have been educated about anthrax, response actions, and [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] medication. Because of the time delay inherent in getting final verification that anthrax has been used, prophylactic antibiotic treatment of possibly exposed personnel must be started as soon as possible.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

== History ==
{{See also|List of anthrax outbreaks}}

=== Discovery ===
[[Robert Koch]], a German physician and scientist, first identified the bacterium that caused the anthrax disease in 1875 in [[Wolsztyn|Wollstein]] (now Wolsztyn, Poland).<ref name="pages 277-310"/><ref name="Brock">{{Cite book | veditors = Madigan M, Martinko J |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms |edition=11th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-13-144329-7}}</ref> His pioneering work in the late 19th century was one of the first demonstrations that [[Germ theory of disease|diseases could be caused by microbes]]. In a groundbreaking series of experiments, he uncovered the lifecycle and means of transmission of anthrax. His experiments not only helped create an understanding of anthrax but also helped elucidate the role of microbes in causing illness at a time when debates still took place over [[spontaneous generation#Spontaneous generation|spontaneous generation]] versus [[cell theory]]. Koch went on to study the mechanisms of other diseases and won the 1905 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery of the bacterium causing tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1905/summary/ |website=The Nobel Prize |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |access-date=2021-10-04 |archive-date=23 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523071846/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1905/summary/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Although Koch arguably made the greatest theoretical contribution to understanding anthrax, other researchers were more concerned with the practical questions of how to prevent the disease. In Britain, where anthrax affected workers in the wool, [[worsted]], [[hide (skin)|hide]]s, and [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] industries, it was viewed with fear. [[John Henry Bell]], a doctor born & based in [[Bradford]], first made the link between the mysterious and deadly "woolsorter's disease" and anthrax, showing in 1878 that they were one and the same.<ref>{{cite journal |title=John Henry Bell, M.D., M.R.C.S|journal=British Medical Journal|date=22 September 1906|pages=735–36|pmc=2382239|volume=2|issue=2386|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.2386.735}}</ref> In the early 20th century, [[Friederich Wilhelm Eurich]], the [[Germans|German]] [[bacteriologist]] who settled in Bradford with his family as a child, carried out important research for the local Anthrax Investigation Board. Eurich also made valuable contributions to a [[Home Office]] Departmental Committee of Inquiry, established in 1913 to address the continuing problem of industrial anthrax.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Industrial Infection by Anthrax|journal=British Medical Journal|date=15 November 1913|page=1338|pmc=2346352|volume=2|issue=2759}}</ref> His work in this capacity, much of it collaboration with the factory inspector [[G. Elmhirst Duckering]], led directly to the [[Anthrax Prevention Act]] (1919).

{{Further|Anthrax vaccines}}
[[File:Pasteur inoculating sheep against anthrax. Wellcome L0003758.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis Pasteur inoculating sheep against anthrax]]

Anthrax posed a major economic challenge in [[France]] and elsewhere during the 19th century. Horses, cattle, and sheep were particularly vulnerable, and national funds were set aside to investigate the production of a [[vaccine]]. French scientist [[Louis Pasteur]] was charged with the production of a vaccine, following his successful work in developing methods that helped to protect the important wine and silk industries.<ref name="Jones 2010">{{cite book| vauthors = Jones S |title=Death in a Small Package: A Short History of Anthrax|date=2010|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore}}</ref>

In May 1881, Pasteur – in collaboration with his assistants [[Jean Joseph Henri Toussaint|Jean-Joseph Henri Toussaint]], [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux|Émile Roux]] and others – performed a public experiment at [[Pouilly-le-Fort]] to demonstrate his concept of vaccination. He prepared two groups of 25 [[sheep]], one [[goat]], and several [[cow|cattle]]. The animals of one group were twice injected with an anthrax vaccine prepared by Pasteur, at an interval of 15 days; the control group was left unvaccinated. Thirty days after the first injection, both groups were injected with a culture of live anthrax bacteria. All the animals in the unvaccinated group died, while all of the animals in the vaccinated group survived.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Decker J |title=Deadly Diseases and Epidemics, Anthrax |publisher=Chelesa House Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7910-7302-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/anthraxdeadlydis00jane/page/27 27–28] |url=https://archive.org/details/anthraxdeadlydis00jane/page/27 }}</ref>

After this apparent triumph, which was widely reported in the local, national, and international press, Pasteur made strenuous efforts to export the vaccine beyond France. He used his celebrity status to establish Pasteur Institutes across Europe and Asia, and his nephew, [[Adrien Loir]], travelled to [[Australia]] in 1888 to try to introduce the vaccine to combat anthrax in [[New South Wales]].<ref name="Geison 2014">{{cite book | vauthors = Geison G |title=The Private Science of Louis Pasteur|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref> Ultimately, the vaccine was unsuccessful in the challenging climate of rural Australia, and it was soon superseded by a more robust version developed by local researchers [[John Gunn (researcher)|John Gunn]] and [[John McGarvie Smith]].<ref name="Stark 2012">{{cite journal| vauthors = Stark J |title=Anthrax and Australia in a Global Context: The International Exchange of Theories and Practices with Britain and France, c. 1850–1920|journal=Health and History|date=2012|volume=14|issue=2|pages=1–25 |doi=10.5401/healthhist.14.2.0001|s2cid=142036883 }}</ref>

Cleanups at a Senate Office Building, several contaminated postal facilities, and other US government and private office buildings, a collaborative effort headed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]<ref name = "Wang_2015" />{{rp|3}} showed decontamination to be possible, but time-consuming and costly. Clearing the Senate Office Building of anthrax spores cost $27&nbsp;million, according to the Government Accountability Office. Cleaning the Brentwood postal facility in Washington cost $130&nbsp;million and took 26 months. Since then, newer and less costly methods have been developed.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Wessner D, Dupont C, Charles T, Neufeld J|title=Microbiology |date=3 December 2020 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-119-59249-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzcDEAAAQBAJ&dq=Cleaning+the+Brentwood+postal+facility+in+Washington+cost+%24130+million+and+took+26+months.+Since+then,+newer+and+less+costly+methods+have+been+developed.&pg=PA264 |language=en}}</ref>

Cleanup of anthrax-contaminated areas on ranches and in the wild is much more problematic.

Carcasses may also be buried, though the burying of large animals deeply enough to prevent resurfacing of spores requires much manpower and expensive tools. Carcasses have been soaked in formaldehyde to kill spores, though this has environmental contamination issues. Block burning of vegetation in large areas enclosing an anthrax outbreak has been tried; this, while environmentally destructive, causes healthy animals to move away from an area with carcasses in search of fresh grass. Some wildlife workers have experimented with covering fresh anthrax carcasses with shadecloth and heavy objects. This prevents some scavengers from opening the carcasses, thus allowing the putrefactive bacteria within the carcass to kill the vegetative ''B. anthracis'' cells and preventing sporulation. This method also has drawbacks, as scavengers such as hyenas are capable of infiltrating almost any exclosure.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

In 1942, British scientists at [[Porton Down]] began research on [[Operation Vegetarian]], an ultimately unused [[Biological warfare|biowarfare]] [[military operation plan]] which called for animal feed pellets containing [[Flax|linseed]] infected with anthrax spores of the [[Vollum strain|Vollum-14578 strain]] to be dropped by air over the countryside of [[Nazi Germany]]. The pellets would be eaten by cattle, which would in turn be eaten by the human population and as such severely disrupt the German war effort. In the same year, bioweapons tests were carried out on the uninhabited [[Gruinard Island]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]], with Porton Down scientists studying the effect of anthrax on the island's population of sheep. Ultimately, five million pellets were created, though plans to drop them over Germany using [[Royal Air Force]] bombers in 1944 were scrapped after the success of [[Operation Overlord]] and the subsequent Allied liberation of France. All pellets were destroyed using incinerators in 1945.<ref>{{Cite book| vauthors = Cole LA |title=Clouds of Secrecy: The Army's Germ Warfare Tests Over Populated Areas|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=1990|isbn=978-0-8226-3001-2|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780822630012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Saddam's germ war plot is traced back to one Oxford cow |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1726745,00.html | vauthors = Robertson D |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225102048/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1726745,00.html |archive-date=25 December 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=UK planned to wipe out Germany with anthrax|work=Sunday Herald|location=Glasgow|date=14 October 2001}}</ref>

== Other animals ==
Anthrax, a bacterial disease caused by ''Bacillus anthracis'', can have devastating effects on animals. It primarily affects herbivores such as cattle, sheep, and goats, but a wide range of mammals, birds, and even humans can also be susceptible. Infection typically occurs through the ingestion of spores in contaminated soil or plants. Once inside the host, the spores transform into active bacteria, producing lethal toxins that lead to severe symptoms. Infected animals often exhibit high fever, rapid breathing, and convulsions, and they may succumb to the disease within hours to days. The presence of anthrax can pose significant challenges to livestock management and wildlife conservation efforts, making it a critical concern for both animal health and public health, as it can occasionally be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or contaminated products. Infected animals may stagger, have difficulty breathing, tremble, and finally collapse and die within a few hours.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Anthrax {{!}} FAQs |url=https://www.dshs.texas.gov/anthrax/anthrax-faqs |access-date=2023-10-19 |publisher=Texas DSHS |archive-date=25 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231025120511/https://www.dshs.texas.gov/anthrax/anthrax-faqs |url-status=live }}</ref>
