'''Garbage''', '''trash''' ([[American English]]), '''rubbish''' ([[Commonwealth English]]), or '''refuse''' is [[waste]] material that is discarded by humans, usually due to a perceived lack of utility. The term generally does not encompass bodily waste products, purely liquid or gaseous wastes, or [[toxic waste]] products. Garbage is commonly sorted and classified into kinds of material suitable for specific kinds of disposal.<ref>Susan Strasser, ''Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash'' (2014), p. 6-7.</ref>

==Terminology==
The word ''garbage'' originally meant chicken [[giblets]] and other [[entrails]], as can be seen in the 15th century Boke of Kokery, which has a recipe for ''Garbage''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/texts/cook/medieval/garbagehome/garbage.html|title=Boke of Kokery - Garbage|publisher=British Library|access-date=April 25, 2020|archive-date=October 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201019161511/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/texts/cook/medieval/garbagehome/garbage.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

What constitutes garbage is highly subjective, with some individuals or societies tending to discard things that others find useful or restorable.<ref>Susan Strasser, ''Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash'' (2014), p. 3-4.</ref> The words garbage, refuse, rubbish, trash, and waste are generally treated as interchangeable when used to describe "substances or objects which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard".<ref>J. M. Baptista, ''The Regulation of Water and Waste Services'' (2014), p. 1: "Solid waste, also written as municipal or urban waste, commonly known as trash, garbage, refuse or rubbish, is defined as any substances or objects which the holder discards or intends or is required to discard".</ref><ref>William Viney, ''Waste: A Philosophy of Things'' (2014), p. 1: "The conventional way of thinking about the creation of waste, rubbish, trash, garbage, or whichever words we like to employ to denote things without use, is that the concept like the thing is ''created'', produced through the order or disorder we construe, manufacture or identify in the world".</ref> Some of these terms have historic distinctions that are no longer present. In the 1880s, material to be disposed of was divided into four general categories: ashes (derived from the burning of coal or wood), garbage, rubbish, and street-sweepings.<ref name="Ciment">James Ciment, ''Social Issues in America: An Encyclopedia'' (2015), p. 1844-45.</ref> This scheme of categorization reduced some of these terms to more specific concepts:

{{blockquote|Garbage, the technical term for putrescent organic matter such as kitchen or food scraps, was fed to pigs and other livestock or boiled down in a process known as "rendering," to extract fats, oils, and greases for manufacturing lubricants, or allowed to dry to become commercial fertilizer. Rubbish, a broad category of dry goods including boxes, bottles, tin cans, or virtually anything made from wood, metal, glass, and cloth, could be transformed into new consumer products through a variety of reclamation methods.<ref name="Ciment"/>}}

The distinction between terms used to describe wet and dry discarded material "was important in the days when cities slopped garbage to pigs, and needed to have the wet material separated from the dry", but has since dissipated.<ref name="William L. Rathje 2001 p. 9">William L. Rathje, Cullen Murphy, ''Rubbish!: The Archaeology of Garbage'' (2001), p. 9.</ref>

In urban areas, garbage of all kinds is collected and treated as [[municipal solid waste]]; garbage that is discarded in ways that cause it to end up in the environment, rather than in containers or facilities designed to receive garbage, is considered [[litter]]. Litter is a form of garbage that has been improperly disposed of, and which therefore enters the environment.<ref>Carl A. Zimring, William L. Rathje, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Consumption and Waste: The Social Science of Garbage'' (2012), p. 657.</ref> Notably, however, only a small fraction of garbage that is generated becomes litter, with the vast majority being disposed of in ways intended to secure it from entering the environment.<ref name="William L. Rathje 2001 p. 9"/>  

==Disposal==
{{Main|Municipal solid waste#Disposal}}
The most common method of garbage disposal are [[landfill]]s, in which garbage is buried underground or piled in a collection pit.  Modern landfills often use [[trash compactor]]s to compress garbage into a smaller space.<ref name="Landfill">{{cite web|url=http://www.co.cumberland.nc.us/departments/solid-waste-group/solid-waste-management/ann-street-landfill/how-a-landfill-operates|title=How a Landfill Operates|website=www.co.cumberland.nc.us|access-date=2020-02-22|archive-date=February 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227021919/https://www.co.cumberland.nc.us/departments/solid-waste-group/solid-waste-management/ann-street-landfill/how-a-landfill-operates|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Landfills use protective liners and collection ponds to prevent chemicals from leaching into the soil through [[Runoff (hydrology)|runoff]], and [[methane]] gas from decomposition is collected, sometimes being used in [[power plant]]s.  In [[incineration]], waste is burned to produce power, reducing the space required for disposal but also prodcung [[smoke]] that can contain toxins.<ref>{{cite web|last=Knox |first=Andrew |url=http://www.oneia.ca/files/EFW%20-%20Knox.pdf |title=An Overview of Incineration and EFW Technology as Applied to the Management of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) |publisher=[[University of Western Ontario]] |date=February 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205164320/http://www.oneia.ca/files/EFW%20-%20Knox.pdf |archive-date=5 December 2008 }}</ref>  More recently, [[recycling]] and [[composting]] have been used to decrease the environmental impact of garbage disposal, by allowing garbage to be turned back into raw materials or safely [[biodegraded]], although those methods can be difficult to implement and work with comparatively few types of materials.

==History==
Humans have been creating garbage throughout history, beginning with bone fragments left over from using animal parts and stone fragments discarded from toolmaking.<ref name="Davis">Simon Davis, "By their garbage shall they be known", ''[[New Scientist]]'' (November 17, 1983), p. 506-515.</ref> The degree to which groups of early humans began engaging in [[agriculture]] can be estimated by examining the type and quality of animal bones in their garbage.<ref name="Davis"/> Garbage from prehistoric or pre-civilization humans was often collected into mounds called [[midden]]s, which might contain things such as "a mix of discarded food, [[charcoal]], shell tools, and broken pottery".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.science.org/content/article/prehistoric-garbage-piles-may-have-created-tree-islands|author=Sid Perkins|title=Prehistoric Garbage Piles May Have Created 'Tree Islands'|work=sciencemag.org|date=March 22, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624120348/http://news.sciencemag.org/2011/03/prehistoric-garbage-piles-may-have-created-tree-islands|archive-date=June 24, 2014}}</ref>
