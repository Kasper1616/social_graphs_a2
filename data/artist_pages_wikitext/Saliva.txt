'''Saliva''' (commonly referred as '''spit''' or '''drool''') is an [[extracellular fluid]] produced and secreted by [[salivary gland]]s in the [[mouth]]. In [[human]]s, saliva is around 99% [[water]], plus [[electrolytes]], [[mucus]], [[white blood cells]], [[epithelial cells]] (from which [[DNA]] can be extracted), [[enzymes]] (such as [[lingual lipase]] and [[amylase]]), and [[antiseptic|antimicrobial]] agents (such as secretory [[IgA]], and [[lysozymes]]).<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |last=Nosek |first=Thomas M. |url=http://humanphysiology.tuars.com/program/section6/6ch4/s6ch4_6.htm |title=Essentials of Human Physiology, Section 6, Chapter 4 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117182014/http://humanphysiology.tuars.com/program/section6/6ch4/s6ch4_6.htm |archive-date=2016-01-17}}</ref>

The enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of [[digestion]] of dietary [[starch]]es and [[fat]]s. These enzymes also play a role in breaking down food particles trapped within dental crevices, thus protecting teeth from bacterial decay.<ref name = DCDCM>{{cite book|last1= Fejerskov|first1= O.|last2= Kidd|first2= E.|title= Dental Caries: The Disease and Its Clinical Management|edition= 2nd|year= 2007|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell|isbn= 978-1-4051-3889-5}}</ref> Saliva also performs a lubricating function, wetting [[food]] and permitting the initiation of [[swallowing]], and protecting the [[oral mucosa]] from [[desiccation|drying out]].<ref name = SOH>{{cite book|last1= Edgar|first1= M.|last2= Dawes|first2= C.|last3= O'Mullane|first3= D.|title= Saliva and Oral Health|edition= 3 |publisher= [[British Dental Association]]|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0-904588-87-3}}</ref>

Saliva has specialized purposes for a variety of animal species beyond predigestion. Certain swifts construct nests with their sticky saliva. The foundation of bird's nest soup is an aerodramus nest. Venomous saliva injected by fangs is used by cobras, vipers, and certain other members of the venom clade to hunt. Some caterpillars use modified salivary glands to store silk proteins, which they then use to make silk fiber.<ref>{{cite web|title=Insect-produced silk|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/lands_forests_pdf/silk.pdf|access-date=2019-04-13|archive-date=2017-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131104416/http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/lands_forests_pdf/silk.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Daily salivary output==
Experts debate the amount of saliva that a healthy [[human|person]] produces. Production is estimated at 1,500 [[milliliter|mL]] per day and researchers generally accept that during sleep the amount drops significantly.<ref name="SOH" /><ref>{{cite journal

==Functions==
Via the action of amylase and other enzymes, saliva contributes to the digestion of food and to the maintenance of oral hygiene.<ref name="statp">{{cite web |vauthors=Alhajj M, Babos M |title=Physiology, Salivation |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542251/ |publisher=StatPearls, US National Library of Medicine |access-date=6 March 2025 |date=24 July 2023}}</ref> Saliva limits the growth of bacterial pathogens and is a major factor in sustaining systemic and oral health through the prevention of tooth decay.<ref name=statp/> Saliva also acts as a buffer, reducing acidity of food components by its  bicarbonate and phosphate content.<ref name=statp/> 

===Lubricant===
Saliva coats the [[oral mucosa]], mechanically protecting it from trauma during eating, swallowing, and speaking. Mouth soreness is common in people with reduced saliva ([[xerostomia]]) and food (especially dry food) sticks to the inside of the mouth.<ref name=statp/>

===Digestion===
The digestive functions of saliva include moistening food and helping to create a food [[bolus (digestion)|bolus]]. The lubricative function of saliva allows the food bolus to be passed easily from the mouth into the esophagus. Saliva contains the enzyme amylase, also called ptyalin, which is capable of breaking down starch into simpler sugars such as maltose and dextrin that can be further broken down in the small intestine.<ref name=statp/> About 30% of starch digestion takes place in the mouth cavity. Salivary glands also secrete salivary lipase to begin fat digestion. Salivary lipase plays a large role in fat digestion in newborn infants as their pancreatic lipase still needs some time to develop.<ref>{{cite book

===Role in taste===
Saliva has a role in the [[Taste|sense of taste]].<ref name=statp/> It is the liquid medium in which chemicals are carried to taste receptor cells (mostly associated with [[lingual papilla]]e).<ref name=statp/> People with little saliva may experience [[dysgeusia]] (reduced ability to taste or to experience a metallic taste), occurring as an [[adverse effect]] of some [[prescription drug]]s.<ref name="rad">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rademacher WM, Aziz Y, Hielema A, Cheung KC, de Lange J, Vissink A, Rozema FR |title=Oral adverse effects of drugs: Taste disorders |journal=Oral Diseases |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=213–223 |date=January 2020 |pmid=31532870 |pmc=6988472 |doi=10.1111/odi.13199}}</ref>

===Disease diagnosis===
Saliva can be used in development of [[Non-invasive procedure|non-invasive]] [[biomarker]]s to diagnose the presence or risk of some diseases, such as dental caries and [[periodontal disease]].<ref name="Nonaka"/><ref name=to/><ref name="zhang">{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang CZ, Cheng XQ, Li JY, Zhang P, Yi P, Xu X, Zhou XD |title=Saliva in the diagnosis of diseases |journal=International Journal of Oral Science |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=133–7 |date=September 2016 |pmid=27585820 |pmc=5113094 |doi=10.1038/ijos.2016.38}}</ref>

===Other===
* Saliva maintains the pH of the mouth.<ref name=statp/> Saliva is supersaturated with various ions. Certain salivary proteins prevent precipitation, which would form salts. These ions act as a [[buffering agent|buffer]], keeping the acidity of the mouth within a certain range, typically pH 6.2–7.4.

==Production==
The production of saliva is stimulated both by the [[sympathetic nervous system]] and the [[parasympathetic]].<ref>{{cite book| title= Essentials of Human Physiology| first= Thomas M. |last= Nosek| chapter=Section 6/6ch4/s6ch4_7 |chapter-url=http://humanphysiology.tuars.com/program/section6/6ch4/s6ch4_7.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324124828/http://humanphysiology.tuars.com/program/section6/6ch4/s6ch4_7.htm|archive-date=2016-03-24}}</ref>

Sympathetic stimulation of saliva is to facilitate [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]], whereas parasympathetic stimulation is to facilitate digestion.

Parasympathetic stimulation leads to acetylcholine (ACh) release onto the salivary acinar cells. ACh binds to [[muscarinic receptor]]s, specifically M<sub>3</sub>, and causes an increased intracellular calcium ion concentration (through the IP<sub>3</sub>/DAG second messenger system). Increased calcium causes vesicles within the cells to fuse with the apical cell membrane leading to secretion. ACh also causes the salivary gland to release [[kallikrein]], an enzyme that converts [[kininogen]] to [[lysyl-bradykinin]]. Lysyl-bradykinin acts upon blood vessels and capillaries of the salivary gland to generate [[vasodilation]] and increased [[capillary permeability]], respectively. The resulting increased blood flow to the [[acini]] allows the production of more saliva. In addition, [[Substance P]] can bind to [[Tachykinin]] [[NK1 receptor|NK-1 receptor]]s leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations and subsequently increased saliva secretion. Lastly, both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous stimulation can lead to [[myoepithelium]] contraction which causes the expulsion of secretions from the secretory acinus into the ducts and eventually to the oral cavity.

Sympathetic stimulation results in the release of [[norepinephrine]]. Norepinephrine binding to [[alpha adrenergic receptor|α-adrenergic receptor]]s will cause an increase in intracellular calcium levels leading to more fluid vs. protein secretion. If norepinephrine binds β-adrenergic receptors, it will result in more protein or enzyme secretion vs. fluid secretion. Stimulation by norepinephrine initially decreases blood flow to the salivary glands due to constriction of blood vessels but this effect is overtaken by vasodilation caused by various local vasodilators.

Saliva production may also be pharmacologically stimulated by the so-called [[sialagogue]]s. It can also be suppressed by the so-called [[antisialagogue]]s.

==Behavior==

===Spitting===
[[File:OakDoNotSpitOnFloor.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A building being renovated in the [[Carrollton, Louisiana|Carrollton]] section of [[New Orleans]]]]

[[Spitting]] is the act of forcibly ejecting saliva or other substances from the mouth. In many parts of the world, it is considered rude and a social [[taboo]], and has sometimes been outlawed. In some countries, for example, it has been outlawed for reasons of public decency and attempting to reduce the spread of disease. These laws may not strictly enforced, but in [[Singapore]], the fine for spitting may be as high as SGD$2,000 for multiple offenses, and one can even be arrested.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} In [[China]], expectoration is more socially acceptable (even if officially disapproved of or illegal), and [[spittoon]]s are still a common appearance in some cultures. Some animals, even humans in some cases, use spitting as an automatic defensive maneuver. [[Camel]]s are well known for doing this, though most domestic camels are trained not to.

Spitting by an infected person (for example, one with [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]]) whose saliva contains large amounts of [[virus]],<ref name="to">{{cite journal |first1=Kelvin Kai-Wang |last1=To |first2=Owen Tak-Yin |last2=Tsang |first3=Cyril Chik-Yan |last3=Yip |first4=Kwok-Hung |last4=Chan |first5=Tak-Chiu |last5=W |first6=Jacky Man-Chun |last6=Chan |first7=Wai-Shing |last7=Leung |first8=Thomas Shiu-Hong |last8=Chik |first9=Chris Yau-Chung |last9=Choi |first10=Darshana H |last10=Kandamby |first11=David Christopher |last11=Lung |first12=Anthony Raymond |last12=Tam |first13=Rosana Wing-Shan |last13=Poon |first14=Agnes Yim-Fong |last14=Fung |first15=Ivan Fan-Ngai |last15=Hung |first16=Vincent Chi-Chung |last16=Cheng |first17=Jasper Fuk-Woo |last17=Chan |first18=Kwok-Yung |last18=Yuen |author-link18=Yuen Kwok-yung |title=Consistent Detection of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in Saliva |journal=[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=12 February 2020 |volume=71 |issue=15 |pages=841–843 |doi=10.1093/cid/ciaa149|pmid=32047895 |pmc=7108139 }}</ref> is a health hazard to the public.

===Wound licking===
{{Main|Wound licking}}A common belief is that saliva contained in the mouth has natural [[disinfection|disinfectants]], which leads people to believe it is beneficial to "[[wound licking|lick their wounds]]". Researchers at the [[University of Florida]] at [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] have discovered a [[protein]] called [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) in the saliva of [[mouse|mice]]. Wounds doused with NGF healed twice as fast as untreated and unlicked wounds; therefore, saliva can help to heal wounds in some species. NGF has been found in human saliva, as well as [[antibacterial]] agents as secretory [[mucin]], [[IgA]], [[lactoferrin]], [[lysozyme]] and [[peroxidase]].<ref name="Grewal Bordoni Ryan 2020 p.

===Classical conditioning===
{{Main|Classical conditioning}}
In [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov's]] experiment, [[dog]]s were conditioned to salivate in response to a ringing bell; this stimulus is associated with a [[meal]] or [[hunger]]. Salivary secretion is also associated with [[nausea]]. Saliva is usually formed in the [[mouth]] through an act called [[wiktionary:gleek|gleeking]], which can be voluntary or involuntary.
