'''''Tyrannosaurus''''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ᵻ|ˌ|r|æ|n|ə|ˈ|s|ɔː|r|ə|s|,_|t|aɪ|-}}){{efn|name=title|{{lit|tyrant lizard}}; {{etymology|grc|''{{wikt-lang|grc|τύραννος}}'' ({{grc-transl|τύραννος}})|tyrant||''{{wikt-lang|grc|σαῦρος}}'' ({{grc-transl|σαῦρος}})|lizard}}}} is a [[genus]] of large [[theropoda|theropod]] [[dinosaur]]. The [[type species]] '''''Tyrannosaurus rex''''' ({{lang|la|rex}} meaning 'king' in [[Latin]]), often shortened to '''''T. rex''''' or colloquially '''t-rex''', is one of the best represented theropods. It lived throughout what is now western [[North America]], on what was then an island continent known as [[Laramidia]]. ''Tyrannosaurus'' had a much wider range than other [[Tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]]. [[Fossil]]s are found in a variety of [[geological formations]] dating to the latest [[Campanian]]-[[Maastrichtian]] [[Age (geology)|ages]] of the late [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]], 72.7 to 66&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|million years ago]], with isolated specimens possibly indicating an earlier origin in the middle Campanian. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-[[Bird|avian]] dinosaurs to exist before the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].

Like other tyrannosaurids, ''Tyrannosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[carnivore]] with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of ''Tyrannosaurus'' were short but unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures {{cvt|12.3|-|12.4|m}} in length, but according to most modern estimates, ''Tyrannosaurus'' could have exceeded sizes of {{cvt|13|m}} in length, {{cvt|3.7|-|4|m}} in hip height, and {{cvt|8.8|t}} in mass. Although some other theropods might have rivaled or exceeded ''Tyrannosaurus'' in [[dinosaur size|size]], it is still among the largest known land predators, with its estimated bite force being the largest among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was most likely an [[apex predator]], preying upon [[hadrosaur]]s, juvenile armored herbivores like [[ceratopsia]]ns and [[ankylosaur]]s, and possibly [[sauropod]]s. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a [[scavenger]]. The question of whether ''Tyrannosaurus'' was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates in [[paleontology]]. Most paleontologists today accept that ''Tyrannosaurus'' was both a predator and a scavenger.

Some [[Specimens of Tyrannosaurus|specimens of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'']] are nearly complete skeletons. [[Soft tissue]] and [[protein]]s have been reported in at least one of these specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of the animal's biology, including its life history and [[biomechanics]]. The feeding habits, [[physiology]], and potential speed of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' are a few subjects of debate. Its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] is also controversial. The Asian ''[[Tarbosaurus bataar]]'' is very closely related to ''Tyrannosaurus'' and has sometimes been seen as a species of this genus. Several North American tyrannosaurids have been [[synonym (biology)|synonymized]] with ''Tyrannosaurus'', while some ''Tyrannosaurus'' specimens have been proposed as distinct species. The validity of these species, such as the more recently discovered '''''T. mcraeensis''''', is contentious.

''Tyrannosaurus'' has been one of the best-known dinosaurs since the early 20th century. Science writer [[Riley Black]] has called it the "ultimate dinosaur". Its fossils have been a popular attraction in museums and has appeared in media like ''[[Jurassic Park]]''.

===Earliest finds===
[[File:AMNH 3982 Manospondylus.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Type (biology)|Type specimen]] (AMNH 3982) of ''Manospondylus gigas'']]
A tooth from what is now documented as a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was found in July 1874 upon [[South Table Mountain (Colorado)]] by [[Jarvis Hall (Colorado)]] student Peter T. Dotson under the auspices of Prof. [[Arthur Lakes]] near [[Golden, Colorado]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Colorado Transcript|date=July 8, 1874|via=www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org}}</ref> In the early 1890s, [[John Bell Hatcher]] collected postcranial elements in eastern [[Wyoming]]. The fossils were believed to be from the large species ''[[Ornithomimus|Ornithomimus grandis]]'' (now ''[[Deinodon]]'') but are now considered ''T. rex'' remains.<ref name="quinlanetal2007" />

In 1892, [[Edward Drinker Cope]] found two vertebral fragments of a large dinosaur. Cope believed the fragments belonged to an "agathaumid" ([[Ceratopsidae|ceratopsid]]) dinosaur, and named them ''Manospondylus gigas'', meaning "giant porous vertebra", in reference to the numerous openings for blood vessels he found in the bone.<ref name="quinlanetal2007">{{Cite journal |last1=Breithaupt |first1=B.

[[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] recognized the similarity between ''Manospondylus gigas'' and ''T. rex'' as early as 1917, by which time the second vertebra had been lost. Owing to the fragmentary nature of the ''Manospondylus'' vertebrae, Osborn did not synonymize the two genera, instead considering the older genus indeterminate.<ref name="osborn1917">{{Cite journal |last=Osborn |first=H.

===Skeleton discovery and naming===
[[File:Tyrannosaurus skeleton.jpg|thumb|Outdated skeletal restoration by [[William Diller Matthew|William D. Matthew]] from 1905, published alongside Osborn's description paper]]
[[Barnum Brown]], assistant curator of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], found the first partial skeleton of ''T. rex'' in eastern Wyoming in 1900. Brown found another partial skeleton in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] in Montana in 1902, comprising approximately 34 fossilized bones.<ref name="osborn1905" /> Writing at the time Brown said "Quarry No. 1 contains the femur, pubes, humerus, three vertebrae and two undetermined bones of a large Carnivorous Dinosaur not described by [[Othniel Charles Marsh|Marsh]].&nbsp;... I have never seen anything like it from the [[Cretaceous]]."<ref name="dingus2010" /> [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], president of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], named the second skeleton ''T. rex'' in 1905. The generic name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words {{lang|grc|τύραννος}} ({{translit|grc|tyrannos}}, meaning "tyrant") and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σαῦρος|σαῦρος]]}} ({{translit|grc|sauros}}, meaning "lizard"). Osborn used the [[Latin language|Latin]] word {{lang|la|rex}}, meaning "king", for the specific name. The full [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] therefore translates to "tyrant lizard the king" or "King Tyrant Lizard", emphasizing the animal's size and presumed dominance over other species of the time.<ref name="osborn1905" />

[[File:Dynamosaurus holotype.jpg|thumb|left|''Dynamosaurus imperiosus'' [[holotype]] (NHMUK PV R8020, previously AMNH 5886) on display at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London]]
Osborn named the other specimen ''Dynamosaurus imperiosus'' in a paper in 1905.<ref name="osborn1905" /> In 1906, Osborn recognized that the two skeletons were from the same species and selected ''Tyrannosaurus'' as the preferred name.<ref name="osborn1906" /> In 1941, the ''T. rex'' type specimen was sold to the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for $7,000.<ref name="dingus2010">{{Cite book |title=Barnum Brown: The Man Who Discovered ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' |url=https://archive.org/details/barnumbrownmanwh00ding |url-access=limited |last1=Dingus |first1=L. |last2=Norell |first2=M. |date=May 3, 2010 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-94552-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/barnumbrownmanwh00ding/page/n106 90], 124}}</ref> The original ''Dynamosaurus'' material now resides in the collections of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London.<ref name="Breithaupt">{{Cite journal |last1=Breithaupt |first1=B.

From the 1910s through the end of the 1950s, Barnum's discoveries remained the only specimens of ''Tyrannosaurus'', as the [[Great Depression]] and wars kept many paleontologists out of the field.<ref name="larson2008" />

===Resurgent interest===
[[File:FMNH SUE Trex.jpg|alt=|thumb|Specimen "[[Sue (dinosaur)|Sue]]", [[Field Museum of Natural History]], Chicago]]
Beginning in the 1960s, there was renewed interest in ''Tyrannosaurus'', resulting in the recovery of 42 skeletons (5–80% complete by bone count) from Western North America.<ref name="larson2008" /> In 1967, Dr. William MacMannis located and recovered the skeleton named "MOR 008", which is 15% complete by bone count and has a reconstructed skull displayed at the [[Museum of the Rockies]]. The 1990s saw numerous discoveries, with nearly twice as many finds as in all previous years, including two of the most complete skeletons found to date: [[Sue (dinosaur)|Sue]] and [[Stan (dinosaur)|Stan]].<ref name="larson2008" />

[[Sue Hendrickson]], an [[amateur]] paleontologist, discovered the most complete (approximately 85%) and largest ''Tyrannosaurus'' skeleton in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] on August 12, 1990. The specimen Sue, named after the discoverer, was the object of a legal battle over its ownership. In 1997, the litigation was settled in favor of Maurice Williams, the original land owner. The fossil collection was purchased by the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] at auction for $7.6&nbsp;million, making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton until the sale of Stan for $31.8 million in 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=T.

===Footprints===
[[File:Philmont T-Rex 2022.jpg|left|thumb|Probable footprint from [[New Mexico]]]]
Two isolated fossilized [[footprint]]s have been tentatively assigned to ''T. rex''. The first was discovered at [[Philmont Scout Ranch]], New Mexico, in 1983 by American geologist Charles Pillmore. Originally thought to belong to a [[hadrosaurid]], examination of the footprint revealed a large 'heel' unknown in [[ornithopod]] dinosaur tracks, and traces of what may have been a [[hallux]], the dewclaw-like fourth digit of the tyrannosaur foot. The footprint was published as the [[ichnogenus]] ''[[Tyrannosauripus pillmorei]]'' in 1994, by [[Martin Lockley]] and Adrian Hunt. Lockley and Hunt suggested that it was very likely the track was made by a ''T. rex'', which would make it the first known footprint from this species. The track was made in what was once a vegetated wetland mudflat. It measures {{convert|83|cm|in|sp=us}} long by {{convert|71|cm|in|sp=us}} wide.<ref name="lockley&hunt1994">{{Cite journal |last1=Lockley |first1=M. G. |last2=Hunt |first2=A.

A second footprint that may have been made by a ''Tyrannosaurus'' was first reported in 2007 by British paleontologist Phil Manning, from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] of Montana. This second track measures {{convert|72|cm|in|sp=us}} long, shorter than the track described by Lockley and Hunt.

A set of footprints in Glenrock, Wyoming dating to the [[Maastrichtian]] stage of the Late Cretaceous and hailing from the [[Lance Formation]] were described by Scott Persons, Phil Currie and colleagues in 2016, and are believed to belong to either a juvenile ''T. rex'' or the dubious tyrannosaurid ''Nanotyrannus lancensis''.

The [[vertebral column]] of ''Tyrannosaurus'' consisted of ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae and five sacral vertebrae. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and could well have varied between individuals but probably numbered at least forty. Sue was mounted with forty-seven of such caudal vertebrae.<ref name="brochu2003" /> The neck of ''T. rex'' formed a natural S-shaped curve like that of other theropods. Compared to these, it was exceptionally short, deep and muscular to support the massive head. The second vertebra, the axis, was especially short. The remaining neck vertebrae were weakly opisthocoelous, i.e. with a convex front of the vertebral body and a concave rear. The vertebral bodies had single pleurocoels, pneumatic depressions created by [[air sac]]s, on their sides.<ref name="brochu2003" /> The vertebral bodies of the torso were robust but with a narrow waist. Their undersides were keeled. The front sides were concave with a deep vertical trough. They had large pleurocoels. Their neural spines had very rough front and rear sides for the attachment of strong tendons. The sacral vertebrae were fused to each other, both in their vertebral bodies and neural spines. They were pneumatized. They were connected to the pelvis by transverse processes and sacral ribs. The tail was heavy and moderately long, in order to balance the massive head and torso and to provide space for massive [[Animal locomotion|locomotor muscles]] that attached to the thighbones. The thirteenth tail vertebra formed the transition point between the deep tail base and the middle tail that was stiffened by a rather long front articulation processes. The underside of the trunk was covered by eighteen or nineteen pairs of segmented belly ribs.<ref name="brochu2003" />
[[File:The Right Arm of SUE.jpg|thumb|Right forelimb of specimen "Sue"]]
The [[shoulder girdle]] was longer than the entire forelimb. The shoulder blade had a narrow shaft but was exceptionally expanded at its upper end. It connected via a long forward protrusion to the [[coracoid]], which was rounded. Both shoulder blades were connected by a small [[furcula]]. The paired breast bones possibly were made of [[cartilage]] only.<ref name="brochu2003" />

The forelimb or arm was very short. The upper arm bone, the humerus, was short but robust. It had a narrow upper end with an exceptionally rounded head. The lower arm bones, the [[ulna]] and radius, were straight elements, much shorter than the humerus. The second [[metacarpus|metacarpal]] was longer and wider than the first, whereas normally in theropods the opposite is true. The forelimbs had only two clawed fingers,<ref name="brochu2003" /> along with an additional splint-like small third [[metacarpus|metacarpal]] representing the remnant of a third digit.<ref name="CLKC08">{{Cite book |title=''Tyrannosaurus rex'', the Tyrant King |url=https://archive.org/details/tyrannosaurusrex00plar |url-access=limited |last1=Lipkin |first1=C. |last2=Carpenter |first2=K. |date=2008 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-35087-9 |editor-last=Carpenter |editor-first=K. |location=Bloomington |pages=[https://archive.org/details/tyrannosaurusrex00plar/page/n182 167]–190 |chapter=Looking again at the forelimb of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' |editor-last2=Larson |editor-first2=P.

[[File:UCMP Trex pelvis 2.JPG|thumb|left|Pelvic girdle of specimen MOR 555]]
The [[pelvis]] was a large structure. Its upper bone, the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], was both very long and high, providing an extensive attachment area for hindlimb muscles. The front [[pubic bone]] ended in an enormous pubic boot, longer than the entire shaft of the element. The rear [[ischium]] was slender and straight, pointing obliquely to behind and below.<ref name="brochu2003" />

In contrast to the arms, the hindlimbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod. In the foot, the [[metatarsus]] was "arctometatarsalian", meaning that the part of the third metatarsal near the ankle was pinched. The third metatarsal was also exceptionally sinuous.<ref name="brochu2003" /> Compensating for the immense bulk of the animal, many bones throughout the skeleton were hollowed, reducing its weight without significant loss of strength.<ref name="brochu2003" />

''Tyrannosaurus'' is the [[Type (biology)|type]] genus of the superfamily [[Tyrannosauroidea]], the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Tyrannosauridae]], and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae; in other words it is the standard by which paleontologists decide whether to include other species in the same group.

Tyrannosaurids were once commonly thought to be descendants of earlier large theropods such as [[Spinosauroidea|megalosaurs]] and [[Carnosauria|carnosaurs]], although more recently they were reclassified with the generally smaller [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]].<ref name="holtz1994">{{Cite journal |last=Holtz |first=T.

Tyrannosaurs started out as small theropods; however at least some became larger by the [[Early Cretaceous]].  It is quite likely that tyrannosauroids rose to prominence after the decline in allosauroid and megalosauroid diversity seen during the early stages of the Late Cretaceous.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A longirostrine tyrannosauroid from the Early Cretaceous of China |journal=Proc Biol Sci |date=2009 |volume=277 |issue=1679 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0249 |pmc=2842666 |last1=Li |first1=Daqing |last2=Norell |first2=Mark A. |last3=Gao |first3=Ke-Qin |last4=Smith |first4=Nathan D. |last5=Makovicky |first5=Peter J. |pages=183–190 |pmid=19386654 }}</ref>

Tyrannosauroids are characterized by their fused nasals and dental arrangement. Pantyrannosaurs are characterized by unique features in their hips as well as an enlarged foramen in the quadrate, a broad postorbital and hourglass shaped nasals. Some of the more derived pantyrannosaurs lack nasal pneumaticity and have a lower humerus to femur ratio with their arms starting to see some reduction. Some pantyrannosaurs started developing an arctometatarsus. Eutyrannosaurs have a rough texture on their nasal bones and their mandibular fenestra is reduced externally. Tyrannosaurids lack kinetic skulls or special crests on their nasal bones, and have a lacrimal with a distinctive process on it. Tyrannosaurids also have an interfenestral strut that is less than half as big as the maxillary fenestra.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Brusatte |first1=Stephen L. |last2=Norell |first2=Mark A. |last3=Carr |first3=Thomas D. |last4=Erickson |first4=Gregory M. |last5=Hutchinson |first5=John R. |last6=Balanoff |first6=Amy M. |last7=Bever |first7=Gabe S. |last8=Choiniere |first8=Jonah N. |last9=Makovicky |first9=Peter J. |last10=Xu |first10=Xing |date=September 17, 2010 |title=Tyrannosaur Paleobiology: New Research on Ancient Exemplar Organisms |url=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1193304 |journal=Science |language=en |volume=329 |issue=5998 |pages=1481–1485 |doi=10.1126/science.1193304 |pmid=20847260 |bibcode=2010Sci...329.1481B |issn=0036-8075 |archive-date=April 5, 2024 |access-date=April 5, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240405184657/https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1193304 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2001, various tyrannosaurid teeth and a metatarsal unearthed in a quarry near [[Zhucheng]], China, were assigned by Chinese paleontologist [[Hu Chengzhi]] to the newly erected species ''Tyrannosaurus zhuchengensis''. However, in a nearby site, a right maxilla and left jawbone were assigned to the newly erected tyrannosaurid genus ''Zhuchengtyrannus'' in 2011. It is possible that ''T. zhuchengensis'' is [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''Zhuchengtyrannus''.

In 2006, a fragmentary tyrannosaurid lacrimal (CM 9401) from the [[Judith River Formation]] of Fergus County, Montana, was described as ?''Tyrannosaurus'' sp. This isolated right lacrimal was originally collected alongside the holotype specimen of ''Deinosuchus rugosus'', a giant crocodylian, and remained undescribed until its re-identification as belonging to a tyrannosaurid theropod in the 1980s by paleontologist [[Dale Russell]]. The lacrimal closely resembles those of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' in both size and morphology. Notably, it lacks the "lacrimal horn" typically present in earlier tyrannosaurids like ''[[Albertosaurus]]'' and ''[[Gorgosaurus]]'', instead exhibiting a distinct rugosity along the dorsal surface—consistent with ''T. rex'' and its Asian relative ''Tarbosaurus''. The specimen's considerable size places it within the range of known ''T. rex'' individuals, suggesting the presence of large tyrannosaurids during the Campanian stage (~75 million years ago), a temporal range earlier than the established Maastrichtian age (~68–66 Ma) for ''Tyrannosaurus rex''. However, the exact age and provenance of CM 9401 remain uncertain due to a lack of detailed field documentation.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Urban |first1=Michael A. |last2=Lamanna |first2=Matthew C. |date=December 2006 |title=Evidence of a Giant Tyrannosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Upper Cretaceous (?Campanian) of Montana |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2992/0097-4463%282006%2975%5B231%3AEOAGTD%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |journal=Annals of Carnegie Museum |language=en |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=231–235 |doi=10.2992/0097-4463(2006)75[231:EOAGTD]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0097-4463|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

In 2018, a paper describing tyrannosaurid teeth from the Two Medicine Formation noted a premaxillary tooth (YPM VPPU 023469) had a strong resemblance to the teeth of [[Sue (Tyrannosaurus)|Sue]] to the exclusion of any Campanian tyrannosaurid.

===''Tyrannosaurus imperator'' and ''Tyrannosaurus regina''===
In a 2022 study, [[Gregory S. Paul]] and colleagues argued that ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', as traditionally understood, actually represents three species: the type species ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', and two previously unrecognized species: ''T. imperator'' (meaning "tyrant lizard emperor") and ''T. regina'' (meaning "tyrant lizard queen"). The holotype of the former (''T. imperator'') is the [[Sue (dinosaur)|Sue]] specimen, and the holotype of the latter (''T. regina'') is [[Wankel rex]]. The division into multiple species was primarily based on the high degree of variation in the proportions and robusticity of the [[femur]] (and other skeletal elements) across ''T. rex'' specimens. Presumed robust and gracile morphotypes and the number of small incisiform teeth in the dentary were also used as a line of evidence. Paul and colleagues categorized the species as follows: ''T. rex'' demonstrates robust anatomy, a moderate ratio of femur length vs circumference, and the possession of a singular slender incisiform dentary tooth, ''T. imperator'' is robust with a small femur length to circumference ratio and two of the slender teeth, and ''T. regina'' is more gracile with a high femur ratio and one of the slender teeth.<ref name="paul2022">{{cite journal | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-022-09561-5#Sec12 | title=The Tyrant Lizard King, Queen and Emperor: Multiple Lines of Morphological and Stratigraphic Evidence Support Subtle Evolution and Probable Speciation Within the North American Genus Tyrannosaurus | last1=Paul | first1=Gregory S. | last2=Persons IV | first2=W.

Holtz remarked that, even if ''Tyrannosaurus imperator'' represented a distinct species from ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', it may represent the same species as ''Nanotyrannus lancensis'' and would need to be called ''Tyrannosaurus lancensis''. O'Connor, a curator at the Field Museum, where the ''T. imperator'' holotype Sue is displayed, regarded the new species as too poorly-supported to justify modifying the exhibit signs. Brusatte, Carr, and O'Connor viewed the distinguishing features proposed between the species as reflecting natural variation within a species. Both Carr and O'Connor expressed concerns about the study's inability to determine which of the proposed species several well-preserved specimens belonged to. Another paleontologist, [[Philip J. Currie]], originally co-authored the study but withdrew from it as he did not want to be involved in naming the new species.<ref name="newyorktimes"/>

In a subsequent paper published in 2025, Paul maintained the validity of ''T. imperator'' and ''T. regina'', arguing that these proposed species could be further distinguished by the shape of their postorbital bosses (bony rugosities behind the eyes).<ref name="Paul2025">{{Cite journal |last1=Paul |first1=Gregory S. |author1-link=Gregory S.

[[File:Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis (mandibular elements).png|thumb|left|upright|Mandibular elements of the ''T. mcraeensis'' holotype]]
Dalman et al. (2024) proposed the new name ''Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis'' for the holotype (NMMNH P-3698), referencing the McRae Group, the rock layers to which the Hall Lake Formation belongs. The holotype of ''T. mcraeensis'' is found in the strata that are around a few million years older than the accepted range of ''T. rex'', which existed at the end of the Maastrichtian. The rock layers were initially estimated to date to between 72.7 and 70.9 Ma, correlating to the latest Campanian or earliest Maastrichtian.<ref name=T.mcraeensis/> However, in a 2024 [[Academic conference|conference]] [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]]s, the specific stratigraphic layer which yielded ''T. mcraeensis'' was estimated to be younger than 69.0 ± 0.4 Ma and older than 66.0 Ma based on the sandstone from the same fossil locality,<ref>{{cite conference|author1=Schantz, E.|author2=Amato, J.M.|author3=Lawton, T.F.|title=Dating dinosaurs in the Laramide foreland: U-Pb geochronologic constraints on a stratigraphic section containing ''Alamosaurus'' and the postulated Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis in the Love Ranch Basin|conference=New Mexico Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs|volume=56|pages=9}}</ref> which would suggest that the age of ''T. mcraeensis'' is much closer to ''T. rex'' than previously thought.<ref name=Scherer2025/> ''T. mcraeensis'' was estimated at {{convert|12|m|ft}} long, which is similar to the size of an adult ''T. rex''. The two are distinguished by characters of the skull. Amongst these, the dentary of ''T. mcraeensis'' is proportionately longer and possesses a less prominent chin, and the lower jaw shallower than that of ''T. rex'', suggesting a weaker bite. The teeth are likewise blunter and more laterally compressed, while the post orbital crests are less prominent.

The validity of ''T. mcraeensis'' was subsequently questioned by other researchers in 2025. Morrison and colleagues noted the uncertainty in the previous age estimate of ''T. mcraeensis''. The authors argued that the inclusion of the titanosaurian fossil (cf.

In 2001, a more complete juvenile tyrannosaur, nicknamed "[[Jane (dinosaur)|Jane]]" (catalog number BMRP 2002.4.1), belonging to the same species as the original ''Nanotyrannus'' specimen, was uncovered.

[[File:Baby T-rex 0496.JPG|thumb|Illustration of a juvenile ''Tyrannosaurus rex'']]
The identification of several specimens as juvenile ''T. rex'' has allowed scientists to document [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] changes in the species, estimate the lifespan, and determine how quickly the animals would have grown. The smallest known individual ([[Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History|LACM]] 28471, the "Jordan theropod") is estimated to have weighed only {{cvt|30|kg}}, while the largest adults, such as [[Field Museum of Natural History|FMNH]] PR2081 (Sue) most likely weighed about {{cvt|5650|kg}}. [[Histology|Histologic]] analysis of ''T. rex'' bones showed LACM 28471 had aged only 2 years when it died. Sue was initially estimated at 28 years old, an age which was at the time considered close to the maximum for the species,<ref name="ericksonetal2004" /> but the most recent studies estimate Sue's age at 27–33 years.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cullen |first1=Thomas M. |last2=Canale |first2=Juan I. |last3=Apesteguía |first3=Sebastián |last4=Smith |first4=Nathan D. |last5=Hu |first5=Dongyu |last6=Makovicky |first6=Peter J. |date=November 25, 2020 |title=Osteohistological analyses reveal diverse strategies of theropod dinosaur body-size evolution |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |language=en |volume=287 |issue=1939 |pages=20202258 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2020.2258 |issn=0962-8452 |pmc=7739506 |pmid=33234083}}</ref> Similarly, [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix (RGM 792.000)]] is estimated to have been at least 30 years old at time of death.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Trix the T. rex is ready for her big Glasgow reveal |url=https://www.gla.ac.uk/news/archiveofnews/2019/april/headline_644272_en.html |access-date=May 23, 2025 |website=www.gla.ac.uk |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Tyrannosauridae growth rates.svg|thumb|left|A graph showing the hypothesized growth curve, body mass versus age (drawn in black, with other tyrannosaurids for comparison). Based on Erickson and colleagues 2004]]
Histology has also allowed the age of other specimens to be determined. Growth curves can be developed when the ages of different specimens are plotted on a graph along with their mass. A ''T. rex'' growth curve is S-shaped, with juveniles remaining under {{cvt|1800|kg}} until approximately 14 years of age, when body size began to increase dramatically. During this rapid growth phase, a young ''T. rex'' would gain an average of {{cvt|600|kg}} a year for the next four years. At 18 years of age, the curve plateaus again, indicating that growth slowed dramatically. For example, only {{cvt|600|kg}} separated the 28-year-old Sue from a 22-year-old Canadian specimen ([[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology|RTMP]] 81.12.1).<ref name="ericksonetal2004" /> A 2004 histological study performed by different workers corroborates these results, finding that rapid growth began to slow at around 16 years of age.<ref name="hornerpadian2004">{{Cite journal |last1=Horner |first1=J.

A study by Hutchinson and colleagues in 2011 corroborated the previous estimation methods in general, but their estimation of peak growth rates is significantly higher; it found that the "maximum growth rates for T. rex during the exponential stage are 1790 kg/year".<ref name="Hutchinsonet.al.2011" /> Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and the one which would be expected of an animal of its size.<ref name="Hutchinsonet.al.2011" /> The sudden change in growth rate at the end of the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the [[femur]] of a 16 to 20-year-old ''T. rex'' from Montana ([[Museum of the Rockies|MOR]] 1125, also known as [[B-rex]]).

[[File:Ontogram of Tyrannosaurus rex.png|thumb|Diagram showing growth stages]]
An additional study published in 2020 by Woodward and colleagues, for the journal ''Science Advances'' indicates that during their growth from juvenile to adult, ''Tyrannosaurus'' was capable of slowing down its growth to counter environmental factors such as lack of food. The study, focusing on two juvenile specimens between 13 and 15 years old housed at the Burpee Museum in Illinois, indicates that the rate of maturation for ''Tyrannosaurus'' was dependent on resource abundance. This study also indicates that in such changing environments, ''Tyrannosaurus'' was particularly well-suited to an environment that shifted yearly in regards to resource abundance, hinting that other midsize predators might have had difficulty surviving in such harsh conditions and explaining the niche partitioning between juvenile and adult tyrannosaurs. The study further indicates that ''Tyrannosaurus'' and the dubious genus ''Nanotyrannus'' are synonymous, due to analysis of the growth rings in the bones of the two specimens studied.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Woodward |first1=Holly N |last2=Tremaine |first2=Katie |last3=Williams |first3=Scott A |last4=Zanno |first4=Lindsay E |last5=Horner |first5=John R |last6=Myhrvold |first6=Nathan |date=January 1, 2020 |title=Growing up Tyrannosaurus rex: Osteohistology refutes the pygmy "Nanotyrannus" and supports ontogenetic niche partitioning in juvenile Tyrannosaurus |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=eaax6250 |journal=Science Advances |pmid=31911944 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.aax6250 |pmc=6938697 |bibcode=2020SciA....6.6250W }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/01/nanotyrannus-fossils-really-are-teenage-t-rex-dinosaur-growth-rates/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200101225622/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/01/nanotyrannus-fossils-really-are-teenage-t-rex-dinosaur-growth-rates/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 1, 2020 |last=Greshko |first=Michael |date=January 1, 2020 |title=These sleek predatory dinosaurs really are teenage T. rex |work=[[National Geographic]] |access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref>

Over half of the known ''T. rex'' specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity, a pattern which is also seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large, long-lived birds and mammals today. These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, partly due to the stresses of reproduction. One study suggests that the rarity of juvenile ''T. rex'' fossils is due in part to low juvenile mortality rates; the animals were not dying in large numbers at these ages, and thus were not often fossilized. This rarity may also be due to the incompleteness of the [[fossil record]] or to the bias of fossil collectors towards larger, more spectacular specimens.<ref name="ericksonetal2006" /> In a 2013 lecture, Thomas Holtz Jr. suggested that dinosaurs "lived fast and died young" because they reproduced quickly whereas mammals have long lifespans because they take longer to reproduce.<ref name="HoltzLecture2013">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqkqkxYGNZc  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/sqkqkxYGNZc| archive-date=December 11, 2021 |url-status=live|title=The Life and Times of Tyrannosaurus rex, with Dr. Thomas Holtz |date=March 19, 2013 |last=Holtz |first=T.

In 2023, Cullen and colleagues supported the idea that theropods like tyrannosaurids had lips based on anatomical patterns, such as those of the foramina on their face and jaws, more similar to those of modern [[squamate]]s such as [[monitor lizard]]s or [[marine iguana]]s than those of modern [[crocodilia]]ns like [[alligator]]s. Comparison of the teeth of ''Daspletosaurus'' and [[American alligator]]s shows that the enamel of tyrannosaurids had no significant wear and that the teeth of modern crocodilians were eroded on the labial side and were substantially worn. This suggests that it is likely that theropod teeth were kept wet by lips. On the basis of the relationship between hydration and wear resistance, the authors argued that it is unlikely that the teeth of theropods, including tyrannosaurids, would have remained unworn when exposed for a long time, because it would have been hard to maintain hydration. The authors also performed regression analyses to demonstrate the relationship between tooth height and skull length, and found that [[varanid]]s like the [[crocodile monitor]] had substantially greater ratios of tooth height to skull length than those of ''Tyrannosaurus'', indicating that the teeth of theropods were not too big to be covered by extraoral tissues when the mouth was closed.<ref name=CullenEtAl23/>

===Sexual dimorphism===
[[File:MUJA 04.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Skeleton casts mounted in a mating position, [[Jurassic Museum of Asturias]]]]
As the number of known specimens increased, scientists began to analyze the variation between individuals and discovered what appeared to be two distinct body types, or ''morphs'', similar to some other theropod species. As one of these morphs was more solidly built, it was termed the 'robust' morph while the other was termed '[[Wikt:gracile|gracile]]'. Several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences associated with the two morphs were used to analyze [[sexual dimorphism]] in ''T. rex'', with the 'robust' morph usually suggested to be female. For example, the [[pelvis]] of several 'robust' specimens seemed to be wider, perhaps to allow the passage of [[Egg (biology)|eggs]].<ref name="carpenter1990">{{Cite book |title=Dinosaur Systematics: Approaches and Perspectives |last=Carpenter |first=K. |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-521-43810-0 |editor-last=Carpenter |editor-first=K. |location=[[Cambridge]] |pages=141–145 |chapter=Variation in ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' |author-link=Kenneth Carpenter |editor-last2=Currie |editor-first2=P.

In recent years, evidence for sexual dimorphism has been weakened. A 2005 study reported that previous claims of sexual dimorphism in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error, casting doubt on the existence of similar dimorphism between ''T. rex'' sexes.<ref name="ericksonetal2005">{{Cite journal |last1=Erickson |first1=G.

As ''T. rex'' specimens have been found from [[Saskatchewan]] to [[New Mexico]], differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual dimorphism. The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.<ref name="brochu2003" />

Only a single ''Tyrannosaurus'' specimen has been conclusively shown to belong to a specific sex. Examination of B-rex demonstrated the preservation of [[soft tissue]] within several bones. Some of this tissue has been identified as a medullary tissue, a specialized tissue grown only in modern birds as a source of [[calcium]] for the production of [[eggshell]] during [[ovulation]]. As only female birds lay eggs, medullary tissue is only found naturally in females, although males are capable of producing it when injected with female reproductive [[hormone]]s like [[estrogen]]. This strongly suggests that B-rex was female and that she died during ovulation.<ref name="schweitzeretal2005" /> Recent research has shown that medullary tissue is never found in crocodiles, which are thought to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. The shared presence of medullary tissue in birds and other theropod dinosaurs is further evidence of the close [[evolution]]ary relationship between the two.<ref name="schweitzeretal2007">{{Cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=M.

===Posture===
[[File:T. rex old posture.jpg|thumb|Outdated reconstruction (by [[Charles R. Knight]]), showing upright pose]]
Like many [[bipedal]] dinosaurs, ''T. rex'' was historically depicted as a 'living tripod', with the body at 45 degrees or less from the vertical and the tail dragging along the ground, similar to a [[kangaroo]].

Another possibility is that the forelimbs held struggling prey while it was killed by the tyrannosaur's enormous jaws. This hypothesis may be supported by [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] analysis. ''T. rex'' forelimb bones exhibit extremely thick [[Bone#Structure|cortical bone]], which has been interpreted as evidence that they were developed to withstand heavy loads. The [[biceps brachii]] muscle of an adult ''T. rex'' was capable of lifting {{convert|199|kg|lb|0}} by itself; other muscles such as the [[brachialis]] would work along with the biceps to make elbow flexion even more powerful. The [[M. biceps]] muscle of ''T.&nbsp;rex'' was 3.5 times as powerful as the [[human equivalent]]. A ''T. rex'' forearm had a limited range of motion, with the shoulder and elbow joints allowing only 40 and 45 degrees of motion, respectively. In contrast, the same two joints in ''[[Deinonychus]]'' allow up to 88 and 130 degrees of motion, respectively, while a human arm can rotate 360 degrees at the shoulder and move through 165 degrees at the elbow. The heavy build of the arm bones, strength of the muscles, and limited range of motion may indicate a system evolved to hold fast despite the stresses of a struggling prey animal. In the first detailed scientific description of ''Tyrannosaurus'' forelimbs, paleontologists Kenneth Carpenter and Matt Smith dismissed notions that the forelimbs were useless or that ''Tyrannosaurus'' was an obligate scavenger.<ref name="carpentersmith2001">{{Cite book |title=Mesozoic vertebrate life |last1=Carpenter |first1=K. |last2=Smith |first2=M. |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-253-33907-2 |editor-last=Tanke |editor-first=D.

The idea that the arms served as weapons when hunting prey have also been proposed by [[Steven M.

''Tyrannosaurus'', like most dinosaurs, was long thought to have an [[ectotherm]]ic ("cold-blooded") reptilian [[metabolism]].

Histological evidence of high growth rates in young ''T. rex'', comparable to those of mammals and birds, may support the hypothesis of a high metabolism. Growth curves indicate that, as in mammals and birds, ''T. rex'' growth was limited mostly to immature animals, rather than the [[indeterminate growth]] seen in most other [[vertebrate]]s.<ref name="hornerpadian2004" />

[[Isotopes of oxygen|Oxygen isotope]] ratios in fossilized bone are sometimes used to determine the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than {{convert|4|to|5|C-change|0}} between the vertebrae of the torso and the [[tibia]] of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and [[geochemistry|geochemist]] William Showers to indicate that ''T. rex'' maintained a constant internal body temperature ([[homeotherm]]y) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals.<ref name="barrettshowers1994">{{Cite journal |last1=Barrick |first1=R.

In studies reported in ''Science'' in April 2007, Asara and colleagues concluded that seven traces of [[collagen]] proteins detected in purified ''T. rex'' bone most closely match those reported in [[chicken]]s, followed by frogs and newts. The discovery of proteins from a creature tens of millions of years old, along with similar traces the team found in a mastodon bone at least 160,000 years old, upends the conventional view of fossils and may shift paleontologists' focus from bone hunting to biochemistry. Until these finds, most scientists presumed that fossilization replaced all living tissue with inert minerals. Paleontologist Hans Larsson of McGill University in Montreal, who was not part of the studies, called the finds "a milestone", and suggested that dinosaurs could "enter the field of molecular biology and really slingshot paleontology into the modern world".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2007-04-12-trex-protein_N.htm |title=Yesterday's T.

A 2002 report used a mathematical model (validated by applying it to three living animals: [[alligator]]s, [[chicken]]s, and [[human]]s; and eight more species, including emus and ostriches<ref name="Hutchinson2004" />) to gauge the leg muscle mass needed for fast running (over {{convert|40|km/h|mph|disp=or|abbr=on}}).<ref name="HutchinsonGarcia2002TrexSlow" /> Scientists who think that ''Tyrannosaurus'' was able to run point out that hollow bones and other features that would have lightened its body may have kept adult weight to a mere {{convert|4.5|MT|ST}} or so, or that other animals like [[ostrich]]es and [[horse]]s with long, flexible legs are able to achieve high speeds through slower but longer strides.<ref name="Hutchinson2004" /> Proposed top speeds exceeded {{convert|40|km/h|mph|sp=us}} for ''Tyrannosaurus'', but were deemed infeasible because they would require exceptional leg muscles of approximately 40–86%&nbsp;of total body mass. Even moderately fast speeds would have required large leg muscles. If the muscle mass was less, only {{convert|18|km/h|mph|sp=us}} for walking or jogging would have been possible.<ref name="HutchinsonGarcia2002TrexSlow" /> Holtz noted that tyrannosaurids and some closely related groups had significantly longer [[distal]] hindlimb components (shin plus foot plus toes) relative to the femur length than most other theropods, and that tyrannosaurids and their close relatives had a tightly interlocked [[metatarsus]] (foot bones).<ref name="Holtz1998TaxonomyCoelurosauria">{{Cite journal |last=Holtz |first=T.

Additionally, a 2020 study indicates that ''Tyrannosaurus'' and other tyrannosaurids were exceptionally efficient walkers. Studies by Dececchi et al., compared the leg proportions, body mass, and the gaits of more than 70 species of theropod dinosaurs including ''Tyrannosaurus'' and its relatives. The research team then applied a variety of methods to estimate each dinosaur's top speed when running as well as how much energy each dinosaur expended while moving at more relaxed speeds such as when walking. Among smaller to medium-sized species such as dromaeosaurids, longer legs appear to be an adaptation for faster running, in line with previous results by other researchers. But for theropods weighing over {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, top running speed is limited by body size, so longer legs instead were found to have correlated with low-energy walking. The results further indicate that smaller theropods evolved long legs as a means to both aid in hunting and escape from larger predators while larger theropods that evolved long legs did so to reduce the energy costs and increase foraging efficiency, as they were freed from the demands of predation pressure due to their role as apex predators. Compared to more basal groups of theropods in the study, tyrannosaurs like ''Tyrannosaurus'' itself showed a marked increase in foraging efficiency due to reduced energy expenditures during hunting or scavenging. This in turn likely resulted in tyrannosaurs having a reduced need for hunting forays and requiring less food to sustain themselves as a result. Additionally, the research, in conjunction with studies that show tyrannosaurs were more agile than other large-bodied theropods, indicates they were quite well-adapted to a long-distance stalking approach followed by a quick burst of speed to go for the kill. Analogies can be noted between tyrannosaurids and modern wolves as a result, supported by evidence that at least some tyrannosaurids were hunting in group settings.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The fast and the frugal: Divergent locomotory strategies drive limb lengthening in theropod dinosaurs |first1=T.

A study published in 2021 by Pasha van Bijlert et al., calculated the [[preferred walking speed]] of ''Tyrannosaurus'', reporting a speed of {{convert|1.28|m/s|km/h mph|sp=us}}. While walking, animals reduce their [[cost of transport|energy expenditure]] by choosing certain step rhythms at which their body parts [[resonate]]. The same would have been true for [[dinosaurs]], but previous studies did not fully account for the impact the tail had on their walking speeds. According to the authors, when a dinosaur walked, its tail would slightly sway up and down with each step as a result of the [[interspinous ligaments]] suspending the tail. Like rubber bands, these ligaments stored energy when they are stretched due to the swaying of the tail. Using a 3-D model of ''Tyrannosaurus'' specimen [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]], muscles and ligaments were reconstructed to simulate the tail movements. This results in a rhythmic, energy-efficient walking speed for ''Tyrannosaurus'' similar to that seen in living animals such as humans, ostriches and giraffes.<ref name=vanBijlert2021>{{cite journal |author1=van Bijlert, P.

However, studies by Eric Snively and colleagues'','' published in 2019 indicate that ''Tyrannosaurus'' and other tyrannosaurids were more maneuverable than allosauroids and other theropods of comparable size due to low rotational inertia compared to their body mass combined with large leg muscles. As a result, it is hypothesized that ''Tyrannosaurus'' was capable of making relatively quick turns and could likely pivot its body more quickly when close to its prey, or that while turning, the theropod could "pirouette" on a single planted foot while the alternating leg was held out in a suspended swing during a pursuit. The results of this study potentially could shed light on how agility could have contributed to the success of tyrannosaurid evolution.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cotton |first1=J.

===Possible footprints===
[[File:T. rex rising (Caneer et.al. 2021).png|thumb|Depiction of ''Tyrannosaurus'' rising from the ground, based on fossil tracks described in 2021]]
Rare fossil footprints and trackways found in New Mexico and Wyoming that are assigned to the ichnogenus ''[[Tyrannosauripus]]'' have been attributed to being made by ''Tyrannosaurus'', based on the stratigraphic age of the rocks they are preserved in. The first specimen, found in 1994 was described by Lockley and Hunt and consists of a single, large footprint. Another pair of ichnofossils, described in 2021, show a large tyrannosaurid rising from a prone position by rising up using its elbows in conjunction with the pads on their feet to stand. These two unique sets of fossils were found in Ludlow, Colorado and Cimarron, New Mexico.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348002331|last1=Caneer|first1=T.|last2=Molkestad|first2=T.|last3=Lucas|first3=S.G.|title=TRACKS IN THE UPPER CRETACEOUS OF THE RATON BASIN POSSIBLY SHOW TYRANNOSAURID RISING FROM A PRONE POSITION|journal=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science|year=2021|pages=29–37}}</ref> Another ichnofossil described in 2018, perhaps belonging to a juvenile ''Tyrannosaurus'' or the dubious genus ''Nanotyrannus'' was uncovered in the Lance Formation of Wyoming.

A study conducted by [[Lawrence Witmer]] and Ryan Ridgely of Ohio University found that ''Tyrannosaurus'' shared the heightened sensory abilities of other [[coelurosaur]]s, highlighting relatively rapid and coordinated eye and head movements; an enhanced ability to sense low frequency sounds, which would allow tyrannosaurs to track prey movements from long distances; and an enhanced sense of smell.<ref name="witmer2009">{{Cite journal |last1=Witmer |first1=L.

Thomas Holtz Jr. would note that high depth perception of ''Tyrannosaurus'' may have been due to the prey it had to hunt, noting that it had to hunt ceratopsians such as ''[[Triceratops]]'', ankylosaurs such as ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'', and hadrosaurs. He would suggest that this made precision more crucial for ''Tyrannosaurus'' enabling it to, "get in, get that blow in and take it down." In contrast, ''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]'' had limited depth perception because they hunted large sauropods, which were relatively rare during the time of ''Tyrannosaurus''.<ref name="HoltzLecture2013" />

Though no ''Tyrannosaurus'' [[Scleral Ring|sclerotic ring]] has been found, [[Kenneth Carpenter]] estimated its size based on that of ''Gorgosaurus''. The inferred sclerotic ring for the [[Stan (dinosaur)|Stan specimen]] is ~{{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on|sp=us}} in diameter with an internal aperture diameter of ~{{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Based on eye proportions in living reptiles, this implies a pupil diameter of about {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|sp=us}}, an iris diameter about that of the sclerotic ring, and an eyeball diameter of {{convert|11-12|cm|in|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Carpenter also estimated an eyeball depth of ~{{convert|7.7-9.6|cm|in|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Based on these calculations, the [[f-number]] for Stan's eye is 3–3.8; since [[Diurnality|diurnal]] animals have f-numbers of 2.1 or higher, this would indicate that ''Tyrannosaurus'' had poor low-light vision and hunted during the day.<ref name="Trexpaleobiologychapter14">{{cite book|author=Carpenter, K.|chapter=A Closer Look at the Scavenging versus Predation by ''Tyrannosaurus rex''|title=Tyrannosaurid Paleobiology |year=2013 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-00930-2 |editor-last=Parrish |editor-first=M.

''Tyrannosaurus'' had very large [[olfactory bulb]]s and [[olfactory nerve]]s relative to their brain size, the organs responsible for a heightened sense of smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern [[vulture]]s, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that ''T. rex'' had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.<ref name="Calgary Herald">{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/story.html?id=3641f27e-ca2e-44e8-a56b-f9a0b4aef4b5 |title=''T.

[[File:Tyrannosaurus brain aus.jpg|thumb|Cast of the braincase at the [[Australian Museum]], Sydney]]
Somewhat unusually among theropods, ''T.&nbsp;rex'' had a very long [[cochlea]]. The length of the cochlea is often related to hearing acuity, or at least the importance of hearing in behavior, implying that hearing was a particularly important sense to tyrannosaurs. Specifically, data suggests that ''T. rex'' heard best in the low-frequency range, and that low-frequency sounds were an important part of tyrannosaur behavior.<ref name="witmer2009" /> A 2017 study by Thomas Carr and colleagues found that the snout of tyrannosaurids was highly sensitive, based on a high number of small openings in the facial bones of the related ''Daspletosaurus'' that contained [[sensory neuron]]s. The study speculated that tyrannosaurs might have used their sensitive snouts to measure the temperature of their nests and to gently pick up eggs and hatchlings, as seen in modern crocodylians.<ref name="carr2017" /> 
Another study published in 2021 further suggests that ''Tyrannosaurus'' had an acute sense of touch, based on neurovascular canals in the front of its jaws, which it could utilize to better detect and consume prey. The study, published by Kawabe and Hittori et al., suggests that ''Tyrannosaurus'' could also accurately sense slight differences in material and movement, allowing it to utilize different feeding strategies on different parts of its prey's carcasses depending on the situation. The sensitive neurovascular canals of ''Tyrannosaurus'' also likely were adapted to performing fine movements and behaviors such as nest building, parental care, and other social behavior such as intraspecific communication. The results of this study also align with results made in studying the related tyrannosaurid ''[[Daspletosaurus horneri]]'' and the [[allosauroid]] ''[[Neovenator]]'', which have similar neurovascular adaptations, suggesting that the faces of theropods were highly sensitive to pressure and touch.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/08912963.2021.1965137|title=Complex neurovascular system in the dentary of Tyrannosaurus|year=2021|last1=Kawabe|first1=Soichiro|last2=Hattori|first2=Soki|journal=Historical Biology|volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=1137–1145|doi-access=free|bibcode=2022HBio...34.1137K }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2021-08-rex-jaw-sensors-fearsome-predator.html|title=T. rex's jaw had sensors that made it an even more fearsome predator|website=phys.org|access-date=August 23, 2021|archive-date=August 23, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210823232627/https://phys.org/news/2021-08-rex-jaw-sensors-fearsome-predator.html|url-status=live}}</ref> However, a more recent study reviewing the evolution of the trigeminal canals among sauropsids notes that a much denser network of neurovascular canals in the snout and lower jaw is more commonly encountered in aquatic or semiaquatic taxa (e.g., ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', ''[[Halszkaraptor]]'', ''[[Plesiosaurus]]''), and taxa that developed a rhamphotheca (e.g., ''[[Caenagnathasia]]''), while the network of canals in ''Tyrannosaurus'' appears simpler, though still more derived than in most ornithischians, and overall  
terrestrial taxa such as tyrannosaurids and ''Neovenator'' may have had average facial sensitivity for non-edentulous terrestrial theropods, although further research is needed. The neurovascular canals in ''Tyrannosaurus'' may instead have supported soft tissue structures for thermoregulation or social signaling, the latter of which could be confirmed by the fact that the neurovascular network of canals may have changed during ontogeny.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benoit|first=Florian Bouabdellah, Emily Lessner, and Julien|date=January 20, 2022|title=The rostral neurovascular system of Tyrannosaurus rex|url=https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/2022/3518-t-rex-trigeminal-canals|journal=Palaeontologia Electronica|language=English|volume=25|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.26879/1178|s2cid=246204236|issn=1094-8074|doi-access=free|archive-date=March 16, 2022|access-date=January 22, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220316214524/https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/2022/3518-t-rex-trigeminal-canals|url-status=live}}</ref>

A study by Grant R. Hurlburt, Ryan C. Ridgely and Lawrence Witmer obtained estimates for [[Encephalization Quotient]]s (EQs), based on reptiles and birds, as well as estimates for the ratio of cerebrum to brain mass. The study concluded that ''Tyrannosaurus'' had the relatively largest brain of all adult non-avian dinosaurs with the exception of certain small maniraptoriforms (''[[Bambiraptor]]'', ''[[Troodon]]'' and ''[[Ornithomimus]]''). The study found that ''Tyrannosaurus'''s relative brain size was still within the range of modern reptiles, being at most 2 [[standard deviations]] above the mean of non-avian reptile EQs. The estimates for the ratio of cerebrum mass to brain mass would range from 47.5 to 49.53 percent. According to the study, this is more than the lowest estimates for extant birds (44.6 percent), but still close to the typical ratios of the smallest sexually mature alligators which range from 45.9–47.9 percent.<ref name="Trexpaleobiologychapter6">{{Cite book |title=Tyrannosaurid Paleobiology |last1=Hurlburt |first1=G.

* Since at least some of ''Tyrannosaurus''{{'}}s potential prey could move quickly, evidence that it walked instead of ran could indicate that it was a scavenger.<ref name="Horner1994SteakKnives" /> On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that ''Tyrannosaurus'', while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, may well have been fast enough to prey on large [[hadrosaurs]] and [[ceratopsians]].<ref name="HutchinsonGarcia2002TrexSlow" /><ref name="manningetal2008" />

Other evidence suggests hunting behavior in ''Tyrannosaurus''. The eye sockets of tyrannosaurs are positioned so that the eyes would point forward, giving them [[binocular vision]] slightly better than that of modern [[hawk]]s.

''Tyrannosaurus'' may have had infectious [[saliva]] used to kill its prey, as proposed by [[William Abler]] in 1992. Abler observed that the {{Dinogloss|serrations}} (tiny protuberances) on the cutting edges of the teeth are closely spaced, enclosing little chambers. These chambers might have trapped pieces of carcass with bacteria, giving ''Tyrannosaurus'' a deadly, infectious bite much like the [[Komodo dragon]] was thought to have.<ref name="abler1992">{{Cite journal |last=Abler |first=W.

====Cannibalism====
Evidence also strongly suggests that tyrannosaurs were at least occasionally cannibalistic. ''Tyrannosaurus'' itself has strong evidence pointing towards it having been cannibalistic in at least a scavenging capacity based on tooth marks on the foot bones, humerus, and metatarsals of one specimen.<ref name="HornerCurrie_et.al._2010_Trex_cannibalism">{{Cite journal |last1=Longrich |first1=N.

The tooth marks were identified in the [[humerus]], foot bones and [[metatarsal]]s, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed it would be difficult to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bitemarks were made in a carcass. As the bitemarks were made in body parts with relatively scantly amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the ''Tyrannosaurus'' was feeding on a cadaver in which the more fleshy parts already had been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other [[Tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]] practiced cannibalism.<ref name=HornerCurrie_et.al._2010_Trex_cannibalism />

=== Parenting ===
While there is no direct evidence of ''Tyrannosaurus'' raising their young (the rarity of juvenile and nest Tyrannosaur fossils has left researchers guessing), it has been suggested by some that like its closest living relatives, modern archosaurs (birds and crocodiles) ''Tyrannosaurus'' may have protected and fed its young. Crocodilians and birds are often suggested by some paleontologists to be modern analogues for dinosaur parenting.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Farlow|first=James Orville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jXU6atz3RTYC&dq=dinosaur+parenting+behavior&pg=PA21|title=Paleobiology of the Dinosaurs|date=1989|publisher=Geological Society of America|isbn=978-0-8137-2238-2|language=en}}</ref> Direct evidence of parental behavior exists in other dinosaurs such as ''[[Maiasaura|Maiasaura peeblesorum]]'', the first dinosaur to have been discovered to raise its young, as well as more closely related [[Oviraptoridae|Oviraptorids]], the latter suggesting parental behavior in theropods.<ref>"Maiasaura," Dodson, et al.

===Pathology===
[[File:T. rex infection.png|thumb|Restoration of an individual (based on [[MOR 980]]) with parasite infections]]
In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for [[stress fractures]] and [[tendon avulsions]] in [[theropod]] dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. Of the 81 ''Tyrannosaurus'' foot bones examined in the study, one was found to have a stress fracture, while none of the 10 hand bones were found to have stress fractures. The researchers found tendon avulsions only among ''Tyrannosaurus'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]''. An avulsion injury left a divot on the humerus of Sue the ''T.&nbsp;rex'', apparently located at the origin of the [[deltoid muscle|deltoid]] or [[teres major]] muscles. The presence of avulsion injuries being limited to the forelimb and shoulder in both ''Tyrannosaurus'' and ''Allosaurus'' suggests that theropods may have had a musculature more complex than and functionally different from those of birds. The researchers concluded that Sue's tendon avulsion was probably obtained from struggling prey. The presence of stress fractures and tendon avulsions, in general, provides evidence for a "very active" predation-based diet rather than obligate scavenging.<ref name="rothschild-dino">{{Cite book |title=Mesozoic Vertebrate Life |last1=Rothschild |first1=B. |last2=Tanke |first2=D.

A 2009 study showed that smooth-edged holes in the skulls of several specimens might have been caused by ''[[Trichomonas]]''-like parasites that commonly infect [[bird]]s. According to the study, seriously infected individuals, including "Sue" and MOR 980 ("Peck's Rex"), might therefore have died from starvation after feeding became increasingly difficult. Previously, these holes had been explained by the bacterious bone infection [[Actinomycosis]] or by intraspecific attacks.<ref name="Wolff">{{Cite journal |last1=Wolff |first1=E. D.

For example, the observed sharp margins with little reactive bone shown by the radiographs of ''Trichomonas''-infected birds are dissimilar to the reactive bone seen in the affected ''T. rex'' specimens. Also, trichomoniasis can be very rapidly fatal in birds (14 days or less) albeit in its milder form, and this suggests that if a ''Trichomonas''-like protozoan is the culprit, trichomoniasis was less acute in its non-avian dinosaur form during the Late Cretaceous.

Another formation with ''Tyrannosaurus'' remains is the [[Lance Formation]] of Wyoming. This has been interpreted as a [[bayou]] environment similar to today's Gulf Coast. The fauna was very similar to Hell Creek, but with ''[[Struthiomimus]]'' replacing its relative ''Ornithomimus''. The small ceratopsian ''[[Leptoceratops]]'' also lived in the area.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Dinosaurs of Wyoming |last=Derstler |first=K. |publisher=Wyoming Geological Association Guidebook, 44th Annual Field Conference.

''Tyrannosaurus'' may have also inhabited Mexico's [[Lomas Coloradas Formation]] in Sonora. Though skeletal evidence is lacking, six shed and broken teeth from the fossil bed have been thoroughly compared with other theropod genera and appear to be identical to those of ''Tyrannosaurus''.

===Population estimates===
[[File:Upper Cretaceous Hell Creek dinosaur census 2.svg|thumb|Chart of the time-averaged census for large-bodied dinosaurs from the entire Hell Creek Formation in the study area]]
According to studies published in 2021 by Charles Marshall et al., the total population of adult ''Tyrannosaurus'' at any given time was perhaps 20,000 individuals, with computer estimations also suggesting a total population no lower than 1,300 and no higher than 328,000. The authors themselves suggest that the estimate of 20,000 individuals is probably lower than what should be expected, especially when factoring in that disease pandemics could easily wipe out such a small population. Over the span of the genus' existence, it is estimated that there were about 127,000 generations and that this added up to a total of roughly 2.5 billion animals until their extinction.<ref name="nytimes2021"/><ref name="Marshall2021"/>

In the same paper, it is suggested that in a population of ''Tyrannosaurus'' adults numbering 20,000, the number of individuals living in an area the size of California could be as high as 3,800 animals, while an area the size of Washington D.C. could support a population of only two adult ''Tyrannosaurus''. The study does not take into account the number of juvenile animals in the genus present in this population estimate due to their occupation of a different niche than the adults, and thus it is likely the total population was much higher when accounting for this factor. Simultaneously, studies of living carnivores suggest that some predator populations are higher in density than others of similar weight (such as jaguars and hyenas, which are similar in weight but have vastly differing population densities). Lastly, the study suggests that in most cases, only one in 80 million ''Tyrannosaurus'' would become fossilized, while the chances were likely as high as one in every 16,000 of an individual becoming fossilized in areas that had more dense populations.<ref name="nytimes2021">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/science/tyrannosaurus-rex-population.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211228/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/science/tyrannosaurus-rex-population.html |archive-date=December 28, 2021 |url-access=limited|title=How Many Tyrannosaurus Rexes Ever Lived on Earth?

Meiri (2022) questioned the reliability of the estimates, citing uncertainty in metabolic rate, body size, sex and age-specific survival rates, habitat requirements and range size variability as shortcomings Marshall et al. did not take into account.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meiri|first=Shai|date=2022|title=Population sizes of T. rex cannot be precisely estimated|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8mj4015f|journal=Frontiers of Biogeography|volume=14|issue=2|language=en|doi=10.21425/F5FBG53781|s2cid=245288933|doi-access=free|archive-date=February 4, 2022|access-date=February 8, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220204051249/https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8mj4015f|url-status=live}}</ref> The authors of the original publication replied that while they agree that their reported uncertainties were probably too small, their framework is flexible enough to accommodate uncerainty in physiology, and that their calculations do not depend on short-term changes in population density and geographic range, but rather on their long-term averages. Finally, they remark that they did estimate the range of reasonable survivorship curves and that they did include uncertainty in the time of onset of sexual maturity and in the growth curve by incorporating the
uncertainty in the maximum body mass.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Charles R.|last2=Latorre|first2=Daniel V.|last3=Wilson|first3=Connor J.|last4=Frank|first4=Tanner M.|last5=Magoulick|first5=Katherine M.|last6=Zimmt|first6=Joshua P.|last7=Poust|first7=Ashley W.|date=2022|title=With what precision can the population size of Tyrannosaurus rex be estimated?

==Cultural significance==
{{Main|Tyrannosaurus in popular culture}}
''Tyrannosaurus'' is the most widely known dinosaur in [[popular culture]]. Science writer [[Riley Black]] states, "In all of prehistory, there is no animal that commands our attention quite like ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', the king of the tyrant lizards. Since the time this dinosaur was officially named in 1905, the enormous carnivore has stood as the ultimate dinosaur."<ref>{{cite book |author=Riley Black |title=The Last Days of the Dinosaurs: An Asteroid, Extinction, and the Beginning of Our World |location=New York |publisher=St Martin's Press |year=2022 |page=219 |isbn=978-1-250-27105-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CtBEAAAQBAJ&q=%22in.all.of.prehistory%22&pg=PA1}}</ref> Paleontologist David Hone notes the popularity of ''Tyrannosaurus'' models and skeletal displays in museums and writes that films like  ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' "would not have been the same without it."<ref>{{cite book|last=Hone|first=David|year=2016|title=The Tyrannosaur Chronicles: The Biology of the Tyrant Dinosaurs|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|page=23|isbn=9781472911278}}</ref> ''T. rex'' is the only dinosaur that is commonly known to the general public by its full scientific name ([[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]]) and the scientific abbreviation ''T.&nbsp;rex'' has also come into wide usage.<ref name="brochu2003" /> [[Robert T. Bakker]] notes this in ''[[The Dinosaur Heresies]]'' and explains that, "a name like {{'}}''T. rex''{{'}} is just irresistible to the tongue."<ref name="bakker1986" />
