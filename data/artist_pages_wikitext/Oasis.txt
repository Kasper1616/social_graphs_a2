In [[ecology]], an '''oasis''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|eɪ|s|ɪ|s}}; {{plural form}}: '''oases''' {{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|eɪ|s|iː|z}}) is a fertile area of a [[desert]] or semi-desert environment<ref name=":1">{{in lang|fr}} [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00004609 Battesti, Vincent (2005) Jardins au désert: Évolution des pratiques et savoirs oasiens: Jérid tunisien.

Surface water may be present, or water may only be accessible from wells or underground channels created by humans. In geography, an oasis may be a current or past rest stop on a transportation route, or less-than-verdant location that nonetheless provides access to underground water through deep wells created and maintained by humans. Although they depend on a natural condition, such as the presence of water that may be stored in reservoirs and used for irrigation, most oases, as we know them, are artificial.<ref>{{Cite web |title=G176: 5.5 De la adaptación a la creación de ambientes artificiales: los efectos de la presencia humana en las zonas áridas |url=https://ocw.unican.es/mod/page/view.php?id=660&lang=en |access-date=2024-07-19 |website=ocw.unican.es |archive-date=2024-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240521203439/https://ocw.unican.es/mod/page/view.php?id=660&lang=en |url-status=live }}</ref>

The word ''oasis'' came into English from {{langx|la|oasis}}, from {{langx|grc|ὄασις}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|óasis}}, which in turn is a direct borrowing from [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]]. The word for ''oasis'' in the latter-attested [[Coptic language]] (the descendant of Demotic Egyptian) is ''wahe'' or ''ouahe'' which means a "dwelling place".<ref name="OnlineEtymology">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=oasis&searchmode=none|title=Etymonline - Origin of 'Oasis'|author=Douglas Harper|dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary|access-date=2011-07-30|archive-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804214413/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=oasis&searchmode=none|url-status=live}}</ref> Oasis in Arabic is ''wāḥa'' ({{langx|ar|واحة}}).

Rain showers provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the [[Tuat]]. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by [[migrating bird]]s, which also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water's edge forming an oasis. It can also be used to plant crops.

===Geography===
Oases in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] cover about {{convert|1000000|hectare|km2}}, however, they support the livelihood of about 10 million inhabitants.<ref name="Jaradat">{{cite web |last=Jaradat |first=Abdullah A. |title=Biodiversity of Date Palm |url=https://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c10/E1-05A-66.pdf |website=USDA-ARS |access-date=2022-09-22 |archive-date=2022-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220802232437/https://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c10/E1-05A-66.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> The stark ratio of oasis to desert land in the world means that the oasis [[ecosystem]] is "relatively minute, rare and precious."<ref name="aeon" />

In some oases systems, there is "a geometrical system of raised channels that release controlled amounts of the water into individual plots, soaking the soil."<ref name="Yale" />

===History===
Oases often have human histories that are measured in millennia.

[[Anthropology|Anthropologically]], the oasis is "an area of sedentary life, which associates the city [''medina''] or village [''[[ksar]]''] with its surrounding feeding source, the palm grove, within a relational and circulatory nomadic system."<ref name="biskra">{{Cite journal |last1=Hadagha |first1=Fatma Zohra |last2=Farhi |first2=Bourhane Eddine |last3=Farhi |first3=Abdallah |last4=Petrisor |first4=Alexandru Ionut |date=2018-12-29 |title=Multifunctionality of the oasis ecosystem.

The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas; caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of [[Awjila]], [[Ghadames]] and [[Kufra]], situated in modern-day [[Libya]], have at various times been vital to both north–south and east–west [[Trans-Saharan trade|trade in the Sahara Desert]]. The location of oases also informed the Darb El Arba'īn trade route from Sudan to Egypt, as well as the caravan route from the [[Niger River]] to [[Tangier]], Morocco.<ref name="aeon" /> The [[Silk Road]] "traced its course from water hole to water hole, relying on oasis communities such as [[Turpan]] in China and [[Samarkand]] in Uzbekistan."<ref name="aeon" />

According to the United Nations, "Oases are at the very heart of the overall development of peri-Saharan countries due to their geographical location and the fact they are preferred migration routes in times of famine or insecurity in the region."<ref name="fao" />

Oases in [[Oman]], on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] near the [[Persian Gulf]], vary somewhat from the Saharan form. While still located in an arid or semi-arid zone with a date palm overstory, these oases are usually located ''below plateaus'' and "watered either by springs or by [[Aflaj Irrigation Systems of Oman|''aflaj'']], tunnel systems dug into the ground or carved into the rock to tap underground aquifers." This rainwater harvesting system "never developed a serious salinity problem."<ref name="Jaradat" />

===Palm Oasis===
In the drylands of southwestern North America, there is a habitat form called Palm Oasis (alternately Palm Series or Oasis Scrub Woodland) that has the native [[California fan palm]] as the overstory species.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Laudenslayer |first=William F.

People who live in an oasis must manage land and water use carefully. The most important plant in an oasis is the date palm ([[date palm|''Phoenix dactylifera'' L.]]), which forms the [[Ecological succession|upper layer]]. These palm trees provide shade for smaller understory trees like [[apricot]]s, [[Common fig|figs]], [[olive]]s, and [[peach]] trees, which form the middle layer. Market-garden vegetables, some cereals (such as [[sorghum]], [[barley]], [[millet]], and [[wheat]]), and/or mixed animal [[fodder]], are grown in the bottom layer where there is more moisture.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/oasis-geological-feature|title=Oasis, geological feature|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en|archive-date=2018-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616155810/https://www.britannica.com/science/oasis-geological-feature|url-status=live}}</ref> The oasis is integrated into its desert environment through an often close association with nomadic [[transhumant]] livestock farming (very often pastoral and sedentary populations are clearly distinguished). The fertility of the oasis soil is restored by "cyclic organic inputs of animal origin."<ref name="biskra" /> In summary, an oasis palm grove is a highly anthropized and irrigated area that supports a traditionally intensive and polyculture-based agriculture.<ref name=":1" />

Responding to environmental constraints, the three strata create what is called the "[[oasis effect]]".<ref name=":1" /> The three layers and all their interaction points create a variety of combinations of "horizontal wind speed, relative air temperature and relative air humidity."<ref name="Jaradat" /> The plantings—through a [[virtuous cycle]] of wind reduction, increased shade and [[evapotranspiration]]—create a [[microclimate]] favorable to crops; "measurements taken in different oases have showed that the potential evapotranspiration of the areas was reduced by 30 to 50 percent within the oasis."<ref name="biskra" />

{{Blockquote|The oases consist of almost unbroken forests of date palms, divided up into many gardens that are separated by mud walls and intersected by innumerable irrigation and drainage ditches… In the shade of the palms are grown many other kinds of fruit trees—oranges, olives, figs, apricots, peaches, pomegranates, and jujubes—interlaced with large grape vines that often hang in festoons from the palm trunks. Beneath the trees are small plots of garden vegetables, barley, and alfalfa. Neither date palms nor other trees are planted with any regularity, and the growth is often so dense that the garden resembles a tropical jungle. Very beautiful are these gardens in the spring, when the apricot and peach trees are in blossom here and there among the palms and the figs and vines are putting forth their leaves. In autumn, when the dates are ripening, the color effects, especially when the tops of the palms are lit up by the last rays of the setting sun, are something that once seen can never be forgotten. The great clusters of fruit, displaying every tint from bright yellow, through orange, vermilion, and maroon, to plum purple and chestnut brown, with their brilliant yellow or rich orange ivory-like stalks, contrast superbly with the dull bluish or gray green of the feathery crowns of foliage. It is small wonder that a whole folklore of poetic legends and proverbs has grown up around the date palm in the regions where it flourishes.

==Distressed systems==
Many historic oases have struggled with drought and inadequate maintenance.

According to a United Nations report on the future of oases in the Sahara and [[Sahel]], "Increasingly{{nbsp}}... oases are subject to various pressures, heavily influenced by the effects of [[climate change]], decreasing groundwater levels and a gradual loss of cultural heritage due to a fading historical memory concerning traditional water management techniques. These natural pressures are compounded by demographic pressures and the introduction of modern water pumping techniques that can disrupt traditional resource management schemes, particularly in the North Saharan oases."<ref name="fao" />

For example, five historic oases in the [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert of Egypt]] ([[Kharga Oasis|Kharga]], [[Dakhla Oasis|Dakhla]], [[Farafra, Egypt|Farafra]], [[Bahariya Oasis|Baharyia]], and [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]]) once had "flowing spring and wells" but due to the decline of groundwater heads because of overuse for land reclamation projects those water sources are no more and the oases suffer as a result.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Aziz |first1=Ameer |last2=Sabet |first2=Hassan S. |last3=Ghoubachi |first3=Saad Y. |last4=Abu Risha |first4=Usama A. |date=2022-07-01 |title=The origin and recharge conditions of groundwater in Farafra Oasis, Western Desert, Egypt |journal=Scientific African |language=en |volume=16 |article-number=e01179 |doi=10.1016/j.sciaf.2022.e01179|bibcode=2022SciAf..1601179A |s2cid=248041232 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

A 1920 USGS publication about watering holes in the deserts of California and Arizona gave this advice for travelers seeking oases:<ref>{{Cite book |last=Brown |first=John S.

{{blockquote|The usual watering places are springs or wells. Springs are frequently clogged with gravel or rubbish or sometimes even with the bodies of dead animals, and it may be necessary to clean them out. For this work a shovel is needed. Wells may or may not be equipped with pumps. Frequently the pumps are broken and useless, and a rope and bucket are then necessary to obtain water. Most of the wells in this region are less than 100 feet deep, but some are deeper, and 100 feet of rope is not too much to provide. As a rule the rope and bucket at a well, if they were ever provided, soon disappear, and one should never trust the chance of finding them there. Open wells are sometimes contaminated in the same way as springs and need to be cleaned out, particularly in little-frequented places where they are unused for months at a time.}}
