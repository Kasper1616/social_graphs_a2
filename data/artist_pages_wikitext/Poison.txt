In [[science]], '''poison''' is one of the [[chemical substances]] that is harmful or [[Lethality|lethal]] to a [[Organism|living organism]]. The term of poison is used in a wide range of [[Branches of science|scientific fields]] and industries, where it is often specifically defined. It may also be applied [[Colloquial|colloquially]] or figuratively, with a broad sense. 

The symptoms and effects of poisoning in humans can mimic those of other medical conditions and vary depending on the type of poison and the system of the body affected. Common symptoms include alterations in consciousness, abnormal body temperature, irregular heart rate, and changes in respiration. The severity and specific presentation of symptoms often depend on the nature and dose of the poison involved.

Certain poisons, particularly caustic or irritating substances, can cause direct injury to mucous membranes in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. These injuries may result in symptoms such as pain, coughing, vomiting, and shortness of breath.

The term '''[[poisoning]]''' refers to the harmful physiological effects that result from the exposure to a toxic substance, typically through ingestion, inhalation, injection, or skin absorption. It is derived from the word ''poison'' and is commonly used in medical, biochemical, and toxicological contexts to describe adverse interactions between a substance and a living organism.

'''Poisoning''' is sometimes used as a method of [[self-harm]], particularly in cases of intentional '''self-poisoning''' among individuals experiencing [[suicidal ideation]]. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'', self-poisoning is one of the leading methods of suicide attempts among [[adolescents]], and has been identified as the third-leading cause of suicide-related deaths in this age group. A study published in the ''Journal of Pediatrics'' found that suicide attempts by poisoning among individuals under the age of 19 doubled between 2000 and 2018, increasing from nearly 40,000 cases to almost 80,000.

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19]] lockdowns, reports indicated a 37% increase in cases of deliberate self-poisoning among adolescent girls. In [[biology]], a poison is a [[chemical substance]] causing [[death]], injury or harm to [[Organism|organisms]] or their parts. In [[medicine]], poisons are a kind of [[toxin]] that are delivered passively, not actively. In industry the term may be negative, something to be removed to make a thing safe, or positive, an agent to limit unwanted [[Pest (organism)|pests]]. In [[Ecology|ecological terms]], poisons introduced into the environment can later cause unwanted effects elsewhere, or in other parts of the [[food chain]].

== Etymology ==
The word '''poison''' was first recorded in English around the year 1200, meaning "a deadly potion or substance." It derives from the [[Old French]] ''poison'' or ''puison'' (12th century; Modern French: ''poison''), originally meaning "a drink," particularly a medicinal one. By the 14th century, the term had come to signify "a (magic) potion" or "poisonous drink." These uses trace back to the [[Latin]] word ''potionem'' (nominative: ''potio''), meaning "a drinking" or "a drink," and more specifically "a poisonous drink," as seen in the writings of [[Cicero]]. The Latin root comes from the verb ''potare'', meaning "to drink." 

The use of "poison" as an adjective in the form "poisonous" dates back to the 1520s. The practice of using "poison" in combination with plant names began in the 18th century. For example, the term '''[[poison oak]]''' was first recorded in 1743, and '''[[poison ivy]]''' appeared in usage by 1784. The expression '''[[poison gas]]''' was first used during [[World War I]] in 1915. <ref name="etymonline.com2" />

== Terminology ==
{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2025}}
The term '''poison''' is often used [[Colloquial|colloquially]] to describe any harmful substance, especially [[corrosive]] substances, [[Carcinogen|carcinogens]], [[Mutagen|mutagens]], [[Teratogen|teratogens]], and harmful [[Pollutant|pollutants]]. In everyday language, it is sometimes used to exaggerate the perceived danger of certain chemicals. The 16th-century physician [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541), regarded as the father of [[toxicology]], famously stated: "Everything is poison, there is poison in everything. [[The dose makes the poison|Only the dose makes a thing not a poison]]." (See: [[Median lethal dose|LD₅₀]]).

The term is also used in a [[Figurative language|figurative]] sense—for example: "His brother's presence poisoned the atmosphere at the party." In contrast, legal definitions of "poison" tend to be narrower. Some substances that are not legally required to carry a "poison" label may still cause medical conditions associated with poisoning.

Some poisons are also classified as '''[[toxins]]''', which are toxic substances produced by living organisms. Examples include bacterial [[proteins]] responsible for conditions such as [[tetanus]] and [[botulism]]. While a distinction exists between "poison" and "toxin", the terms are often used interchangeably, even in scientific contexts. Related adjectives include ''toxic'' and ''poisonous'', which are generally considered synonymous.

Poisonous substances introduced into the body by [[Sting (biology)|sting]] or [[bite]] are known as '''venoms'''. In everyday usage, a '''poisonous organism''' is one that causes harm when ingested or touched, while a '''venomous organism''' uses venom actively to incapacitate prey or deter predators. Although rare, some organisms may be both poisonous and venomous.

All living organisms produce substances to defend themselves from being eaten. However, the term "poison" typically refers to substances that are toxic to humans. Substances that are toxic primarily to pathogens and not to humans are generally classified as '''[[antibiotics]]'''. For instance, ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'' produces compounds toxic to bacteria, but not to humans, making them effective as [[antibacterial]] drugs. Similarly, human [[antimicrobial peptides]], which are toxic to viruses, fungi, bacteria, and cancerous cells; are considered part of the [[innate immune system]].

In [[nuclear physics]], the term '''[[nuclear poison]]''' refers to a substance that absorbs neutrons and interferes with a nuclear reaction.

Substances classified as [[environmentally hazardous]] are not always poisonous, and vice versa. For example, wastewater from food processing, such as potato juice or milk; can be environmentally damaging by depleting oxygen in aquatic ecosystems (leading to [[eutrophication]]), but it poses no direct toxic threat to humans and is not considered a poison.

From a biological standpoint, virtually any substance can be toxic in sufficient quantity. Even something as essential as [[water]] can be fatal when consumed in excessive amounts; a condition known as '''[[water intoxication]]'''. Many drugs used in [[Pharmacology|medicine]], such as [[fentanyl]], have a median lethal dose (LD₅₀) only slightly higher than their effective dose (ED₅₀), highlighting the thin margin between therapeutic benefit and toxicity. Some classification systems differentiate between lethal substances with therapeutic value and those without.

==Modern definitions==
In broad metaphorical (colloquial) usage of the term, "poison" may refer to anything deemed harmful.

In [[biology]], poisons are [[Chemical substance|substances]] that can cause [[death]], injury, or harm to [[organs]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[Cell (biology)|cells]], and [[DNA]] usually by chemical reactions or other [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] on the [[molecular]] scale, when an organism is exposed to a sufficient quantity.<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poison "Poison"] at ''Merriam-Webster''. Retrieved December 26th, 2014.</ref>

[[Medicinal]] fields (particularly [[veterinary medicine]]) and [[zoology]] often distinguish poisons from ''[[toxins]]'' and ''[[venoms]]''. Both poisons and venoms are toxins, which are [[toxicant]]s produced by organisms in nature.<ref name=AustralianAcademyOfSciencePoisonvsVenom>{{cite web|title=Poison vs. Venom|work=[[Australian Academy of Science]]|date=3 November 2017 |url=https://www.science.org.au/curious/people-medicine/poison-vs-venom|access-date=17 April 2022}}</ref><ref name="Chippaux Goyffon 2006 pp. 215–20">{{cite journal|last1=Chippaux|first1=JP|last2=Goyffon|first2=M|title=[Venomous and poisonous animals--I.

==Uses==
[[Industrial sector|Industry]], [[agriculture]], and other sectors employ many poisonous substances, usually for reasons other than their [[toxicity]] to humans. Examples include medicines (e.g. [[anthelmintic]]s used on chickens<ref name="The Arsenic in Your Chicken">{{cite web |date=13 May 2013 |first=Chris |last=Hunt |title=The Arsenic in Your Chicken |publisher=Huffington Post |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arsenic-in-chicken_b_3267334}}</ref><ref name="FDA-Arsenic in Chicken">{{cite web |title=Did the FDA Admit That 70% of U.S. Chickens Contain Arsenic? |publisher=Snopes |date=20 Jan 2015 |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chicken-contains-arsenic/}}</ref>), [[solvent]]s (e.g. rubbing alcohol, turpentine), [[cleaning agent|cleaners]] (e.g. bleach, ammonia), [[coatings]] (e.g. [[arsenic]] wallpaper), and [[feedstock]]s. The toxicity itself sometimes has economic value, when it serves agricultural purposes such as [[weed control]] and [[pest control]]. 

Most poisonous industrial compounds have associated [[material safety data sheet]]s and are classified as [[hazardous substance]]s. Hazardous substances are subject to extensive regulation on production, procurement, and use in overlapping domains of [[occupational safety and health]], [[public health]], [[drinking water quality standards]], [[air pollution]], and [[environmental protection]]. Due to the mechanics of [[molecular diffusion]], many poisonous compounds rapidly diffuse into [[Tissue (biology)|biological tissues]], air, water, or [[soil]] on a molecular scale. By the principle of [[entropy]], [[chemical hazard|chemical contamination]] is typically costly or infeasible to reverse, unless specific [[chelating]] agents or [[filtration|micro-filtration]] processes are available. Chelating agents are often broader in scope than the acute target, and therefore their ingestion necessitates careful [[Physician|medical]] or [[veterinarian]] supervision.

[[Pesticide]]s are one group of substances whose prime purpose is their toxicity to various insects and other animals deemed to be pests (e.g., [[rat]]s and [[cockroach]]es). Natural pesticides have been used for this purpose for thousands of years (e.g. concentrated [[table salt]] is toxic to many [[slug]]s and [[Snail|snails]]). [[Bioaccumulation]] of chemically-prepared agricultural [[insecticide]]s is a matter of concern for the many species, especially [[bird]]s, which [[insectivore|consume insects]] as a primary food source. Selective toxicity, controlled application, and controlled [[biodegradation]] are major challenges in [[herbicide]] and pesticide development and in [[chemical engineering]] generally, as all lifeforms on earth share an underlying [[biochemistry]]; organisms exceptional in their environmental resilience are classified as [[extremophile]]s, these for the most part exhibiting radically different susceptibilities.

==Ecological lifetime==
A poison which enters the [[food chain]]—whether of industrial, agricultural, or [[plant defense against herbivory|natural]] origin—might not be immediately toxic to the first organism that [[foodborne illness|ingests]] the toxin, but can become further concentrated in [[predator]]y organisms further up the food chain, particularly [[carnivore]]s and [[omnivore]]s, especially concerning [[fat soluble]] poisons which tend to become stored in biological tissue rather than excreted in [[urine]] or other water-based [[excretion|effluents]].

Apart from food, many poisons readily enter the body through the [[skin]] and [[lung]]s. [[Hydrofluoric acid]] is a notorious contact poison, in addition to its [[corrosion|corrosive]] damage. Naturally occurring [[sour gas]] is a fast-acting atmospheric poison, which can be released by [[volcanic]] activity or [[drilling rig]]s. Plant-based contact irritants, such as that possessed by [[poison ivy]], are often classed as [[allergen]]s rather than poisons; the effect of an allergen being not a poison as such, but to turn the body's [[immune system|natural defenses]] against itself. Poison can also enter the body through faulty [[implant (medicine)|medical implants]], or by [[injection (medicine)|injection]] (which is the basis of [[lethal injection]] in the context of [[capital punishment]]).

In 2013, 3.3 million cases of unintentional human poisonings occurred.<ref>{{cite journal|author=((Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 collaborators)) |title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=22 August 2015|volume=386|issue=9995|pages=743–800|pmid=26063472|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60692-4|pmc=4561509}}</ref> This resulted in 98,000 deaths worldwide, down from 120,000 deaths in 1990.<ref name=GDB2013>{{cite journal|author=((GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death collaborators)) |title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}</ref> In modern society, cases of [[suspicious death]] elicit the attention of the [[Coroner]]'s office and [[forensic science|forensic investigators]].

Of increasing concern since the isolation of natural [[radium]] by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in 1898—and the subsequent advent of [[nuclear physics]] and nuclear technologies—are [[radioactive contamination|radiological poisons]]. These are associated with [[ionizing radiation]], a mode of toxicity quite distinct from chemically active poisons. In [[mammal]]s, chemical poisons are often passed from mother to offspring through the [[placenta]] during gestation, or through [[breast milk]] during [[breastfeeding|nursing]]. In contrast, radiological damage can be passed from mother or father to offspring through genetic [[mutation]], which—if not fatal in [[gestation|miscarriage]] or [[list of genetic disorders|childhood]], or a direct cause of [[infertility]]—can then be passed along again to a subsequent generation. Atmospheric [[radon]] is a natural radiological poison of increasing impact since humans moved from [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles and [[cave dweller|cave dwelling]] to increasingly enclosed structures able to [[radium and radon in the environment|contain radon]] in dangerous concentrations. The 2006 [[poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko]] was a notable use of radiological assassination, presumably meant to evade the normal investigation of chemical poisons.

Poisons widely dispersed into the environment are known as [[pollution]]. These are often of [[human impact on the environment|human origin]], but pollution can also include unwanted biological processes such as toxic [[red tide]], or acute changes to the natural chemical environment attributed to [[invasive species]], which are toxic or detrimental to the prior ecology (especially if the prior ecology was associated with human economic value or an established industry such as [[shellfish]] harvesting).

The scientific disciplines of [[ecology]] and [[environmental resource management]] study the environmental life cycle of toxic compounds and their complex, diffuse, and highly interrelated effects.

==Poisoning==
{{Main|Poisoning}}
[[File:Saka-saka - cassava leaves in mortar and pestle.jpg|thumb|[[Cassava]] leaves contain [[cyanide]] and can thus cause poisoning if not prepared correctly.]]

Poisoning can be either acute or chronic, and caused by a variety of natural or synthetic substances. Substances that destroy tissue but do not absorb, such as [[lye]], are classified as [[corrosive]]s rather than poisons.

=== Acute ===
Acute poisoning is exposure to a poison on one occasion or during a short period of time. Symptoms develop in close relation to the exposure. Absorption of a poison is necessary for systemic poisoning. Furthermore, many common household medications are not labeled with skull and crossbones, although they can cause severe illness or even death. Poisoning can be caused by excessive consumption of generally safe substances, as in the case of [[water intoxication]].

Agents that act on the [[nervous system]] can paralyze in seconds or less, and include both biologically derived [[neurotoxin]]s and so-called [[nerve gas]]es, which may be synthesized for [[chemical warfare|warfare]] or industry.

Inhaled or ingested [[cyanide]], used as a method of [[execution]] in [[gas chamber]]s, or as a [[suicide method]], almost instantly starves the body of energy by [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[enzyme]]s in [[mitochondria]] that make [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Intravenous injection of an unnaturally high concentration of [[potassium chloride]], such as in the execution of prisoners in parts of the United States, quickly stops the [[heart]] by eliminating the [[Membrane potential|cell potential]] necessary for [[muscle contraction]].

Most biocides, including [[pesticide]]s, are created to act as acute poisons to target organisms, although acute or less observable chronic poisoning can also occur in non-target organisms ([[secondary poisoning]]), including the [[human]]s who apply the biocides and other [[beneficial organism]]s. For example, the herbicide [[2,4-D]] imitates the action of a plant hormone, which makes its lethal toxicity specific to plants. Indeed, 2,4-D is not a poison, but classified as "harmful" (EU).

Many substances regarded as poisons are toxic only indirectly, by [[toxication]]. An example is "wood alcohol" or [[methanol]], which is not poisonous itself, but is chemically converted to toxic [[formaldehyde]] and [[formic acid]] in the [[liver]]. Many [[Medication|drug]] molecules are made toxic in the liver, and the genetic variability of certain liver [[enzyme]]s makes the toxicity of many compounds differ between individuals.

Exposure to radioactive substances can produce [[radiation poisoning]], an unrelated phenomenon.

Two common cases of acute natural poisoning are [[theobromine poisoning]] of [[dog]]s and [[cat]]s, and [[mushroom poisoning]] in humans. Dogs and cats are not natural herbivores, but a chemical defense developed by ''[[Theobroma cacao]]'' can be incidentally fatal nevertheless. Many omnivores, including humans, readily consume edible [[fungi]], and thus many fungi have evolved to become [[Amanita phalloides|decisively inedible]], in this case as a direct defense.

=== Chronic ===

[[File:Lagoa vermelha na Mina do Losal 05.jpg|thumb|[[Groundwater pollution|Polluted groundwater]], in this case depicting [[acid mine drainage]], can cause chronic poisoning.]]

Chronic poisoning is long-term repeated or continuous exposure to a poison where symptoms do not occur immediately or after each exposure. The person gradually becomes ill, or becomes ill after a long latent period. Chronic poisoning most commonly occurs following exposure to poisons that [[bioaccumulate]], or are [[biomagnification|biomagnified]], such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[gadolinium]], and [[lead]].

==Management==
* Initial management for all poisonings includes ensuring adequate [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|cardiopulmonary function]] and providing treatment for any symptoms such as [[seizures]], [[shock (circulatory)|shock]], and [[pain]].
* Injected poisons (e.g., from the sting of animals) can be treated by binding the affected body part with a [[pressure bandage]] and placing the affected body part in hot water (with a temperature of 50&nbsp;°C). The pressure bandage prevents the poison being pumped throughout the body, and the hot water breaks it down. This treatment, however, only works with poisons composed of protein-molecules.<ref>Complete diving manual by Jack Jackson</ref>
* In the majority of poisonings the mainstay of management is providing supportive care for the patient, i.e., treating the symptoms rather than the poison.

===Decontamination===
* Treatment of a recently ingested poison may involve gastric decontamination to decrease absorption. Gastric decontamination can involve [[activated charcoal]], [[gastric lavage]], [[whole bowel irrigation]], or [[nasogastric aspiration]]. Routine use of emetics ([[syrup of Ipecac]]), [[cathartic]]s or laxatives are no longer recommended.
** [[Activated charcoal]] is the treatment of choice to prevent poison absorption. It is usually administered when the patient is in the emergency room or by a trained emergency healthcare provider such as a Paramedic or EMT. However, charcoal is ineffective against [[metal]]s such as [[sodium]], [[potassium]], and [[lithium]], and [[Alcohol (chemistry)|alcohol]]s and [[glycol]]s; it is also not recommended for ingestion of corrosive chemicals such as [[acid]]s and [[alkali]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chyka PA, Seger D, Krenzelok EP, Vale JA |title=Position paper: Single-dose activated charcoal |journal=Clin Toxicol |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=61–87 |year=2005 |pmid=15822758|doi=10.1081/CLT-51867 |s2cid=218856921 }}</ref>
** [[Cathartic]]s were postulated to decrease absorption by increasing the expulsion of the poison from the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. There are two types of cathartics used in poisoned patients; saline cathartics ([[sodium sulfate]], [[magnesium citrate]], [[magnesium sulfate]]) and saccharide cathartics ([[sorbitol]]). They do not appear to improve patient outcome and are no longer recommended.<ref name="jtoxclintox2004-cathartics">{{cite journal | title=Position paper: cathartics | journal=J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | year=2004 | pages=243–253 | volume=42 | issue=3 | pmid=15362590 | doi=10.1081/CLT-120039801 | author=Toxicology, American Academy of Clinical| s2cid=46629852 }}</ref>
** [[Emesis]] (i.e. induced by [[ipecac]]) is no longer recommended in poisoning situations, because vomiting is ineffective at removing poisons.<ref name="jtoxclintox2004-emesis">{{cite journal | title=Position paper: Ipecac syrup | journal=J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | year=2004 | pages=133–143 | volume=42 | issue=2 | pmid=15214617 | doi=10.1081/CLT-120037421 | vauthors=((American Academy of Clinical Toxicology; European Association of Poisons Centres Clinical Toxicologists))| s2cid=218865551 }}</ref>
** [[Gastric lavage]], commonly known as a stomach pump, is the insertion of a tube into the stomach, followed by administration of water or saline down the tube. The liquid is then removed along with the contents of the stomach. Lavage has been used for many years as a common treatment for poisoned patients. However, a recent review of the procedure in poisonings suggests no benefit.<ref name="pmid15641639">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vale JA, Kulig K | title = Position paper: gastric lavage | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 933–43 | date = 2004 | pmid = 15641639 | doi = 10.1081/clt-200045006 | s2cid=29957973}}</ref> It is still sometimes used if it can be performed within 1 hour of ingestion and the exposure is potentially life-threatening.
** [[Nasogastric aspiration]] involves the placement of a tube via the nose down into the stomach, the stomach contents are then removed by suction. This procedure is mainly used for liquid ingestions where activated charcoal is ineffective, e.g. [[ethylene glycol poisoning]].
** [[Whole bowel irrigation]] cleanses the bowel. This is achieved by giving the patient large amounts of a [[polyethylene glycol]] solution. The osmotically balanced polyethylene glycol solution is not absorbed into the body, having the effect of flushing out the entire [[gastrointestinal tract]]. Its major uses are to treat ingestion of sustained release drugs, toxins not absorbed by activated charcoal (e.g., [[lithium]], [[iron]]), and for removal of ingested drug packets ([[body packing]]/smuggling).<ref name="jtoxclintox2004-wbi">{{cite journal | title=Position paper: whole bowel irrigation | journal=J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | year=2004 | pages=843–854 | volume=42 | issue=6 | pmid=15533024 | doi=10.1081/CLT-200035932| s2cid=800595 }}</ref>

===Enhanced excretion===
* In some situations elimination of the poison can be enhanced using [[Forced diuresis|diuresis]], [[hemodialysis]], [[hemoperfusion]], [[hyperbaric medicine]], [[peritoneal dialysis]], [[exchange transfusion]] or [[chelation]]. However, this may actually worsen the poisoning in some cases, so it should always be verified based on what substances are involved.

==Epidemiology==
In 2010, poisoning resulted in about 180,000 deaths down from 200,000 in 1990.<ref name=Loz2012>{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=Dec 15, 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|pmc=10790329|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30050819|s2cid=1541253|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2557786|hdl-access=free}}</ref> There were approximately 727,500 emergency department visits in the United States involving poisonings—3.3% of all injury-related encounters.<ref>Villaveces A, Mutter R, Owens PL, Barrett ML.

== Applications ==
Poisonous compounds may be useful either for their toxicity, or, more often, because of another chemical property, such as specific chemical reactivity. Poisons are widely used in industry and agriculture, as chemical reagents, solvents or complexing reagents, e.g. [[carbon monoxide]], [[methanol]] and [[sodium cyanide]], respectively. They are less common in household use, with occasional exceptions such as [[ammonia]] and [[methanol]]. For instance, [[phosgene]] is a highly reactive [[nucleophile]] acceptor, which makes it an excellent reagent for polymerizing [[diol]]s and [[diamine]]s to produce [[polycarbonate]] and [[polyurethane]] plastics. For this use, millions of tons are produced annually. However, the same reactivity makes it also highly reactive towards proteins in human tissue and thus highly toxic. In fact, phosgene has been used as a [[chemical weapon]]. It can be contrasted with [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]], which has only been produced for chemical weapons uses, as it has no particular industrial use.

Biocides need not be poisonous to humans, because they can target metabolic pathways absent in humans, leaving only incidental toxicity. For instance, the herbicide [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] is a mimic of a plant growth hormone, which causes uncontrollable growth leading to the death of the plant. Humans and animals, lacking this hormone and its receptor, are unaffected by this, and need to ingest relatively large doses before any toxicity appears. Human toxicity is, however, hard to avoid with pesticides targeting mammals, such as [[rodenticide]]s.

The risk from toxicity is also distinct from toxicity itself. For instance, the preservative [[thiomersal]] used in vaccines is toxic, but the quantity administered in a single shot is negligible.

==History==
{{Main Article|History of poison}}
