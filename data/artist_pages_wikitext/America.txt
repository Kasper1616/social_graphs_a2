The '''United States of America''' ('''USA'''), also known as the '''United States''' ('''U.S.''') or '''America''', is a country primarily located in [[North America]]. It is a [[federal republic]] of 50 [[U.S. state|states]] and a federal capital district, [[Washington, D.C.]] The 48 [[contiguous states]] border [[Canada]] to the north and [[Mexico]] to the south, with the [[semi-exclave]] of [[Alaska]] in the northwest and the [[archipelago]] of [[Hawaii]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

[[Paleo-Indians]] migrated from North Asia to North America over 12,000 years ago, and formed various civilizations. [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]] established [[Spanish Florida]] in 1513, the first European colony in what is now the continental United States. [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]] followed with the 1607 settlement of [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], the first of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. [[Middle Passage|Forced migration]] of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved Africans]] supplied the labor force to sustain the [[Southern Colonies]]' [[plantation economy]]. Clashes with the [[The Crown|British Crown]] over taxation and lack of [[No taxation without representation|parliamentary representation]] sparked the [[American Revolution]], leading to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, 1776. Victory in the 1775–1783 [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] brought international recognition of U.S. sovereignty and fueled [[Territorial evolution of the United States|westward expansion]], dispossessing [[Native Americans in the United States|native inhabitants]]. As more states [[Admission to the Union|were admitted]], a North–South [[slave states and free states|division over slavery]] led the [[Confederate States of America]] to attempt secession and fight [[Union (American Civil War)|the Union]] in the 1861–1865 [[American Civil War]]. With the United States' victory and reunification, [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|slavery was abolished nationally]]. By 1900, the country had established itself as a [[great power]], a status solidified after its involvement in [[World War I]]. Following [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the U.S. [[American entry into World War II|entered World War II]]. [[Aftermath of World War II|Its aftermath]] left the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]] as rival [[superpower]]s, competing for [[ideological dominance]] and [[international influence]] during the [[Cold War]]. The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's collapse]] in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. national government]] is a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Constitution of the United States|constitutional]] federal republic and [[representative democracy]] with [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|three separate branches]]: [[United States Congress|legislative]], [[United States federal executive departments|executive]], and [[Federal judiciary of the United States|judicial]]. It has a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] national legislature composed of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (a [[lower house]] based on population) and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] (an [[upper house]] based on equal representation for each state). [[Federalism in the United States|Federalism grants substantial autonomy]] to the 50 states. In addition, 574 Native American tribes have [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|sovereignty rights]], and there are 326 [[Native American reservations]]. Since the 1850s, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties have dominated [[American politics]], while [[Americanism (ideology)|American values]] are based on a democratic tradition inspired by the [[American Enlightenment]] movement. 

A [[developed country]], the [[International rankings of the United States|U.S. ranks]] high in economic competitiveness, innovation, and [[Higher education in the United States|higher education]]. Accounting for [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|over a quarter]] of nominal global GDP, [[Economy of the United States|its economy]] has been the world's largest [[List of countries by largest historical GDP|since about 1890]]. It is the [[List of countries by total wealth|wealthiest country]], with the [[Disposable household and per capita income#Household disposable income per capita (OECD)|highest disposable household income per capita]] among [[OECD]] members, though [[Wealth inequality in the United States|its wealth inequality]] is highly pronounced. Shaped by centuries of immigration, the [[culture of the United States|culture of the U.S.]] is diverse and [[Americanization|globally influential]]. Making up [[List of countries with highest military expenditures|more than a third]] of global military spending, the country has [[United States Armed Forces|one of the strongest militaries]] and is a designated [[nuclear state]]. A member of [[International organization membership of the United States|numerous international organizations]], the U.S. plays a major role in global political, cultural, economic, and military affairs.

During the colonial period, [[Slavery in the colonial history of the United States|slavery had been legal in the American colonies]], becoming the main labor force in the [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|large-scale]], [[Antebellum South#Economic structure|agriculture-dependent economies]] of the [[Southern Colonies]] from Maryland to Georgia.

Throughout the 1850s, this [[Slave states and free states|sectional conflict regarding slavery]] was further inflamed by national legislation in the U.S. Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court. In Congress, the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] mandated the forcible return to their owners in the South of slaves taking refuge in non-slave states, while the [[Kansas&ndash;Nebraska Act]] of 1854 effectively gutted the anti-slavery requirements of the Missouri Compromise.<ref>{{cite web |title=Milestone documents: Kansas&ndash;Missouri Act (1854) |date=July 12, 2021 |url=https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/kansas-nebraska-act |agency=National Archives (Washington, D.C.) |access-date=January 5, 2025}}</ref> In its [[Dred Scott v.

=== National government ===
{{Main|Federal government of the United States}}
Composed of three branches, all headquartered in Washington, D.C., the federal government is the national government of the United States. The [[U.S. Constitution]] establishes a [[separation of powers]] intended to provide a system of [[checks and balances]] to prevent any of the three branches from becoming supreme.<ref>{{cite web |author=Killian, Johnny H.

* The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] is a [[bicameral legislature]] made up of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Senate has 100 members&mdash;two residents from each state and elected by that state's voters for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members, elected for a two-year term by the constituency of the [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional district]] where they reside. A [[State legislature (United States)|state's legislature]] decides the district boundaries, which are contiguous within the state.

* The U.S. president is the [[head of state]], [[commander-in-chief]] of the military, [[Head of government|chief executive of the federal government]], and has the ability to veto [[bill (law)|legislative bills]] from the U.S. Congress before they become law. However, [[Veto power in the United States|presidential vetoes]] can be overridden by a two-thirds [[Supermajority#Use in governments around the world|supermajority]] vote in both chambers of Congress. The president appoints the [[Cabinet of the United States|members of the Cabinet]], subject to Senate approval, and names other officials who administer and enforce federal law and policy through [[List of federal agencies in the United States|their respective agencies]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Executive Branch |url=https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-executive-branch/ |website=The White House |access-date=February 11, 2017}}</ref> The president also has clemency power for federal crimes and [[Federal pardons in the United States|can issue pardons]]. Finally, the president has the authority to issue expansive "[[executive orders]]", subject to [[Judicial review in the United States|judicial review]], in a number of policy areas. Candidates for president campaign with a vice-presidential [[running mate]]. Both candidates are elected together, or defeated together, in a presidential election. Unlike other votes in American politics, this is technically an [[indirect election]] in which the winner will be determined by the [[United States Electoral College|U.S. Electoral College]]. There, votes are officially cast by individual electors selected by [[State legislature (United States)|their state legislature]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Interpretation: Article II, Section 1, Clauses 2 and 3 {{!}} Constitution Center |url=https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-ii/clauses/350 |website=National Constitution Center – constitutioncenter.org |language=en}}</ref> In practice, however, each of the 50 states chooses a group of presidential electors who are required by state law to confirm the winner of their state's popular vote. Each state is allocated two electors plus one additional elector for each congressional district in the state, which in effect combines to equal the number of elected officials that state sends to Congress. The District of Columbia, with no representatives or senators, is allocated three electoral votes. Both the president and the vice president serve a four-year term, and the president may be [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|reelected to the office only once]], for one additional four-year term.{{efn|Per the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution, Amendment Twenty-three]], proposed by the U.S. Congress on June 16, 1960, and ratified by the States on March 29, 1961}}
* The [[Federal judiciary of the United States|U.S. federal judiciary]], whose judges are all appointed for life by the president with Senate approval, consists primarily of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], the [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. courts of appeals]], and the [[United States district court|U.S. district courts]]. The lowest level in the federal judiciary is the [[federal district court]], which decides all cases considered to be under "[[Original jurisdiction#Federal and state courts|original jurisdiction]]", such as federal statutes, constitutional law, or [[international treaties]]. After a federal district court has decided a case, its decision may be contested and sent to a higher court, [[Appellate court|a federal court of appeals]]. The U.S. judicial system's 12 [[United States Courts of Appeals|federal circuit]]s divide the country into separate administrative regions for appeals decisions. The next and highest court in the system is the Supreme Court of the United States.<ref name=FedJud /> The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and [[judicial review|overturns those it finds unconstitutional]].<ref name=FedJud>{{multiref2

[[Public transportation in the United States]] is well developed in the largest urban areas, notably New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco; otherwise, coverage is generally less extensive than in most other developed countries. The U.S. also has many relatively [[car-dependent]] localities.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Urban mass transportation planning |author=Black, Alan |date=1995 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-005557-5 |location=New York |oclc=31045097}}</ref>

Long-distance intercity travel is provided primarily by airlines, but travel by rail is more common along the [[Northeast Corridor]], the only [[high-speed rail in the United States|high-speed rail in the U.S.]] that meets international standards. [[Amtrak]], the country's government-sponsored national passenger rail company, has a relatively sparse network compared to that of Western European countries. Service is concentrated in the Northeast, California, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest, and Virginia/Southeast.

[[Folk art of the United States|Folk art]] in [[Colonial america|colonial America]] grew out of artisanal [[Workmanship|craftsmanship]] in communities that allowed commonly trained people to individually express themselves. It was distinct from Europe's tradition of [[High culture|high art]], which was less accessible and generally less relevant to early American settlers.<ref>American folk art the art of the common man in America, 1750-1900. New York, N.Y.: The Museum of Modern Art. 1932.</ref> Cultural movements in art and craftsmanship in colonial America generally lagged behind those of Western Europe. For example, the prevailing medieval style of [[woodworking]] and primitive [[Sculpture of the United States|sculpture]] became integral to early American folk art, despite the emergence of [[Renaissance art|Renaissance styles]] in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The new English styles would have been early enough to make a considerable impact on American folk art, but American styles and forms had already been firmly adopted. Not only did styles change slowly in early America, but there was a tendency for rural artisans there to continue their traditional forms longer than their urban counterparts did&mdash;and far longer than those in Western Europe.<ref name="Coleman-2013" />

The [[Hudson River School]] was a mid-19th-century movement in the visual arts tradition of European [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]]. The 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York City, an exhibition of European [[modern art|modernist art]], shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Milton W. |title=The Story of the Armory Show |date=1988 |publisher=Abbeville Press |location=New York |isbn=0896597954 |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/details/storyofarmorysho00brow}}</ref>

[[American Realism]] and [[American Regionalism]] sought to reflect and give America new ways of looking at itself. [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Marsden Hartley]], and others experimented with new and individualistic styles, which would become known as [[American modernism]]. Major artistic movements such as the [[abstract expressionism]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] and the [[pop art]] of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include [[Alfred Stieglitz]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[Dorothea Lange]], [[Edward Weston]], [[James Van Der Zee]], [[Ansel Adams]], and [[Gordon Parks]].<ref name="Davenport1991">{{cite book |last=Davenport |first=Alma |title=The History of Photography: An Overview |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hca5H_rJZnUC&pg=PA67 |year=1991 |publisher=UNM Press |isbn=978-0-8263-2076-6 |page=67}}</ref>
