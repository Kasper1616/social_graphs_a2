A '''train''' (from [[Old French]] {{lang|fro|trahiner}}, from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|trahere}}, "to pull, to draw")<ref>{{cite web |title=Definition of ''train (noun)'' in Compact OED |website=AskOxford.com |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/train?view=uk |access-date=18 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050526072449/http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/train?view=uk |archive-date=26 May 2005}}</ref> is a series of connected [[vehicle]]s that run along a [[railway track]] and [[Passenger train|transport people]] or [[Rail freight transport|freight]]. Trains are typically pulled or pushed by [[locomotive]]s (often known simply as "engines"), though some are self-propelled, such as [[multiple unit]]s or [[Railcar|railcars]]. Passengers and cargo are carried in [[railroad car]]s, also known as wagons or carriages. Trains are designed to a certain [[Track gauge|gauge]], or distance between rails. Most trains operate on [[steel]] tracks with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport. Many [[Rail transport by country|countries use rail transport]].

Trains have their roots in [[wagonway]]s, which used railway tracks and were [[Horsecar|powered by horses]] or [[Cable railway|pulled by cables]]. Following the invention of the [[steam locomotive]] in the United Kingdom in 1802, trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before. [[Rapid transit]] and [[tram]]s were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of people in and around cities. Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following [[World War II]], [[Diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[electric locomotive]]s replaced steam as the means of motive power. Following the development of [[car]]s, [[truck]]s, and extensive networks of [[highway]]s which offered greater mobility, as well as faster [[airplane]]s, trains declined in importance and market share, and many rail lines were abandoned. The spread of [[bus]]es led to the closure of many rapid transit and tram systems during this time as well.

Since the 1970s, governments, [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]], and train advocates have promoted increased use of trains due to their greater [[fuel efficiency]] and lower [[greenhouse gas emissions]] compared to other modes of land transport. [[High-speed rail]], first built in the 1960s, has proven competitive with cars and planes over short to medium distances. [[Commuter rail]] has grown in importance since the 1970s as an alternative to congested highways and a means to promote [[Transit-oriented development|development]], as has [[light rail]] in the 21st century. Freight trains remain important for the transport of bulk commodities such as coal and grain, as well as being a means of reducing road traffic congestion by freight trucks.

While conventional trains operate on relatively flat tracks with two rails, a number of specialized trains exist which are significantly different in their mode of operation. [[Monorail]]s operate on a single rail, while [[funicular]]s and [[rack railway]]s are uniquely designed to traverse steep slopes. Experimental trains such as high speed [[maglev]]s, which use [[magnetic levitation]] to float above a guideway, are under development since the 1970s and offer higher speeds than even the fastest conventional trains. Trains which use [[alternative fuel]]s such as [[Natural gas vehicle|natural gas]] and [[Hydrail|hydrogen]] are a 21st-century development.

== Types and terminology ==
[[File:Claude Monet - Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare]]'', by [[Claude Monet]], 1877, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
Trains can be sorted into types based on whether they haul passengers or freight (though [[mixed train]]s which haul both exist), by their weight ([[heavy rail]] for regular trains, [[light rail]] for lighter transit systems), by their speed, by their distance (short haul, [[Long-distance train|long distance]], [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental]]), and by what form of track they use. Conventional trains operate on two rails, but several other types of track systems are also in use around the world, such as [[monorail]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of rail transport}}

=== Early history ===
[[File:Stockton & Darlington Railway (Brown via Getty Images).jpg|thumb|Stockton and Darlington special inaugural train 1825: six wagons of coal, directors coach, then people in wagons.]]
Trains are an evolution of wheeled wagons running on stone [[wagonway]]s, the earliest of which were built by [[Babylon]] circa 2,200 BCE.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=8}} Starting in the 1500s, wagonways were introduced to haul material from mines; from the 1790s, stronger iron rails were introduced.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=8}} Following early developments in the second half of the 1700s, in 1804 a steam locomotive built by British inventor [[Richard Trevithick]] powered the first ever steam train.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=9}} Outside of coal mines, where fuel was readily available, steam locomotives remained untried until the opening of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825. British engineer [[George Stephenson]] ran a steam locomotive named [[Locomotion No. 1]] on this {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=off|adj=on|sp=us|order=flip}} long line, hauling over 400 passengers at up to {{convert|8|mph|km/h|sp=us|order=flip}}. The success of this locomotive, and [[Stephenson's Rocket]] in 1829, convinced many of the value in steam locomotives, and within a decade the [[stock market bubble]] known as "[[Railway Mania]]" started across the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Herring|2000|pp=9-11}}
[[File:Union Pacific Big Boy 4014 Departing Las Vegas, NV, October 8th, 2019.jpg|thumb|The [[Union Pacific Big Boy]] locomotives represented the pinnacle of steam locomotive technology and power.|left]]
News of the success of steam locomotives quickly reached the [[History of rail transportation in the United States|United States]], where the first steam railroad opened in 1829.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=12}} American railroad pioneers soon started manufacturing their own locomotives, designed to handle the sharper curves and rougher track typical of the country's railroads.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=12-13}} The other nations of [[History of rail transport#Europe|Europe]] also took note of British railroad developments, and most countries on the continent constructed and opened their first railroads in the 1830s and 1840s, following the first run of a steam train in [[History of rail transport in France|France]] in late 1829.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=14-15}} In the 1850s, trains continued to expand across Europe, with many influenced by or purchases of American locomotive designs.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=14-15}} Other European countries pursued their own distinct designs. Around the world, steam locomotives grew larger and more powerful throughout the rest of the century as technology advanced.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=15}}

Trains first entered service in [[History of rail transport#Latin America|South America]], [[History of rail transport#Africa|Africa]], and [[History of rail transport#Asia|Asia]] through construction by [[Imperialism|imperial powers]], which starting in the 1840s built railroads to solidify control of their colonies and transport cargo for export.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=16-17}} In [[History of rail transport in Japan|Japan]], which was never colonized, railroads first arrived in the early 1870s. By 1900, railroads were operating on every continent besides uninhabited Antarctica.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=17}}

=== New technologies ===
[[File:Djursholmsbanan 1890-tal.jpg|thumb|right|Electric train on [[Djursholmsbanan]] in Stockholm in the 1890s.]]
Even as steam locomotive technology continued to improve, inventors in [[Germany]] started work on alternative methods for powering trains. [[Werner von Siemens]] built the first train powered by electricity in 1879, and went on to pioneer electric [[tram]]s.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=15}} Another German inventor, [[Rudolf Diesel]], constructed the first [[diesel engine]] in the 1890s, though the potential of his invention to power trains was not realized until decades later.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=15}} Between 1897 and 1903, tests of experimental electric locomotives on the [[Royal Prussian Military Railway]] in Germany demonstrated they were viable, setting speed records in excess of {{convert|100|mph|km/h|sp=us|order=flip}}.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=20-21}}[[File:Locomotora_FSBC_2203.jpg|thumb|The [[EMD FT]] set the stage for diesel locomotives to take over from steam.|left]]Early gas powered "[[Doodlebug (railcar)|doodlebug]]" self-propelled railcars entered service on railroads in the first decade of the 1900s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schafer|first=Mike|title=Vintage diesel locomotives|date=1998|publisher=Motorbooks International|isbn=0-7603-0507-2|location=Osceola, WI|pages=10–12|oclc=38738930}}</ref> Experimentation with diesel and gas power continued, culminating in the German "[[DRG Class SVT 877|Flying Hamburger]]" in 1933, and the influential American [[EMD FT]] in 1939.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=20-22}} These successful diesel locomotives showed that diesel power was superior to steam, due to lower costs, ease of maintenance, and better reliability.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=20-23}} Meanwhile, Italy developed an extensive network of electric trains during the first decades of the 20th century, driven by that country's lack of significant coal reserves.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=20-21}}

=== Dieselization and increased competition ===
[[World War II]] brought great destruction to existing railroads across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Following the war's conclusion in 1945, nations which had suffered extensive damage to their railroad networks took the opportunity provided by [[Marshall Plan]] funds (or economic assistance from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and [[Comecon]], for nations behind the [[Iron Curtain]]) and advances in technology to convert their trains to diesel or electric power.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=22-24}} [[Rail transport in France|France]], [[Rail transport in Russia|Russia]], [[Rail transport in Switzerland|Switzerland]], and [[Rail transport in Japan|Japan]] were leaders in adopting widespread [[railway electrification|electrified railroads]], while other nations focused primarily on [[Dieselisation|dieselization]].{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=23-24}} By 1980, the majority of the world's steam locomotives had been retired, though they continued to be used in parts of Africa and Asia, along with a few holdouts in Europe and South America.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=22-23}} [[History of rail transport in China|China]] was the last country to fully dieselize, due to its abundant coal reserves; steam locomotives were used to haul mainline trains as late as 2005 in [[Inner Mongolia]].<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Don|last2=French|first2=Howard W.|date=2005-11-06|title=Last great steam railroad nears end of line|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/world/asia/last-great-steam-railroad-nears-end-of-line.html|access-date=2021-11-06|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Trains began to face strong competition from automobiles and freight trucks in the 1930s, which greatly intensified following World War II.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=23}} After the war, air transport also became a significant competitor for passenger trains. Large amounts of traffic shifted to these new forms of transportation, resulting in a widespread decline in train service, both freight and passenger.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=23-24}} A new development in the 1960s was [[high-speed rail]], which runs on dedicated rights of way and travels at speeds of {{convert|150|mph|km/h|sp=us|order=flip}} or greater. The first high-speed rail service was the Japanese [[Shinkansen]], which entered service in 1964.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=23-25}} In the following decades, high speed rail networks were developed across much of [[high-speed rail in Europe|Europe]] and Eastern Asia, providing fast and reliable service competitive with automobiles and airplanes.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=23-25}} The first high-speed train in the Americas was [[Amtrak]]'s [[Acela]] in the [[high-speed rail in the United States|United States]], which entered service in 2000.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=25}}
[[File:Fuxinghao CR400 high-speed train front.jpg|thumb|China operates an extensive high speed rail network.]]

=== To the present day ===
Towards the end of the 20th century, increased awareness of the benefits of trains for transport led to a revival in their use and importance. Freight trains are significantly more efficient than trucks, while also emitting far fewer greenhouse gas emissions per ton-mile; passenger trains are also far more energy efficient than other modes of transport. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], "On average, rail requires 12 times less energy and emits 7–11 times less [[Greenhouse gas|GHGs]] per passenger-km travelled than private vehicles and airplanes, making it the most efficient mode of motorised passenger transport. Aside from shipping, freight rail is the most energy-efficient and least carbon-intensive way to transport goods."<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 7, 2022|title=Rail - Fuels & Technologies|url=https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/rail|access-date=2022-01-23|website=IEA}}</ref> As such, rail transport is considered an important part of achieving [[sustainable energy]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 2019|title=The Future of Rail – Analysis|url=https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-rail|access-date=2021-11-05|website=IEA|language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Intermodal freight transport|Intermodal]] freight trains, carrying [[Double-stack rail transport|double-stack]] [[shipping container]]s, have since the 1970s generated significant business for railroads and gained market share from trucks.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blaze|first=Jim|date=2020-01-02|title=Will Short-Haul Rail Intermodal Ever Work?|url=https://www.railwayage.com/freight/will-short-haul-rail-intermodal-ever-work/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Railway Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Increased use of commuter rail has also been promoted as a means of fighting [[traffic congestion]] on highways in urban areas.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Associated Press|date=August 6, 2002|title=Shore Line East ridership is up|work=[[Record-Journal]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7JbAAAAIBAJ&pg=PA6|access-date=November 5, 2021}}</ref>{{better source needed|This is an article about a single US rail line -- surely this concept has been covered by sources with wider scopes?|date=October 2023}}

== Components ==

=== Bogies ===
[[File:Railroad truck, FM55-20.Fig8-8.png|thumb|US-style railroad truck (bogie) with [[journal bearing]]s]]
{{Main|Bogie}}
Bogies, also known in North America as trucks, support the wheels and axles of trains. Trucks range from just one axle to as many as four or more. Two-axle bogies are the most common worldwide, as they decrease the impact of track irregularities, improve curve negotiation, and distribute heavy loads more effectively than single-axle bogies.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Okamoto|first=Isao|date=December 1998|title=How Bogies Work|url=https://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr18/pdf/f52_technology.pdf|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|access-date=2021-11-04}}</ref>

=== Couplers ===
{{Main|Railway coupling}}
Train vehicles are linked to one another by various systems of coupling. In much of Europe, India, and South America, trains primarily use [[buffers and chain coupler]]s. In the rest of the world, [[Janney coupler|knuckle coupler]]s are the most popular, with a few local variations persisting (such as [[Wilson coupler]]s in the former Soviet Union). On multiple units all over the world, [[Scharfenberg coupler]]s are common.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=Simon|last2=Cole|first2=Colin|last3=Spiryagin|first3=Maksym|date=2021-06-01|title=A review on design and testing methodologies of modern freight train draft gear system|journal=Railway Engineering Science|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=127–151|doi=10.1007/s40534-021-00237-y|s2cid=236335052|issn=2662-4753|doi-access=free|bibcode=2021RailE..29..127W }}</ref>

=== Brakes ===
{{Main|Railway air brake}}
Because steel wheels on steel rails have a low coefficient of rolling resistance, trains rely on friction brakes applied to many or all wheels to achieve sufficient stopping force. Early trains used manually applied hand brakes: brakemen rode in brakeman’s cabins or atop cars to turn brake wheels as required on downhill grades.  Since 1869, George Westinghouse’s automatic air brake has been nearly universally adopted; his system uses compressed air in a continuous train pipe to apply brakes simultaneously across all cars.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Wired Staff|title=March 5, 1872: Westinghouse Gives Railroads a Brake|date=2012-03-05|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/04/dayintech-0429|access-date=2025-07-11}}</ref>  

=== Warning devices ===
[[File:GO Train Georgetown 5 (cropped).jpg|thumb|This cab car includes a horn (top), a bell (top right), headlights (above the door), classification lights (red lights on side), and ditch lights (white lights on side).]]
For safety and communication, trains are equipped with horns and bells as mandatory audible devices under international and regional regulations—for example, EU Directive 2004/49/EC Annex I specifies “audible devices: bells, horns, klaxons, etc.” as part of level-crossing warning equipment<ref>{{Cite web|title=Directive 2004/49/EC Annex I|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02004L0049-20091218|access-date=2025-07-11}}</ref>—and the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration defines and mandates locomotive audible warning devices (air horn, steam whistle or similar) under 49 CFR 229.129 (“locomotive horn”).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Use of Locomotive Horns NPRM|url=https://nonoise.org/resource/trans/rail/HTML_NPRM.htm|access-date=2025-07-11}}</ref> Steam locomotives traditionally use steam whistles rather than air horns.

=== Cabs ===
Locomotives are in most cases{{failed verification|date=October 2023}} equipped with cabs, also known as driving compartments, where a [[train driver]] controls the train's operation.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wiedrich|first=Bob|date=May 27, 1990|title=All the Comforts of a Locomotive Cab|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1990-05-27-9002130133-story.html|access-date=2021-11-05|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|language=en-US}}</ref>{{globalize-inline|date=October 2023}}{{better source needed|need a better source than a US newspaper article from 33 years ago|date=October 2023}} They may also be installed on unpowered train cars known as [[Control car|cab or control cars]], to allow for a train to operate with the locomotive at the rear.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Comet I Commuter Coaches|url=http://www.whippanyrailwaymuseum.net/exhibits/equipment/passenger-cars/comet-i-commuter-coaches|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Whippany Railway Museum}}</ref>{{better source needed|need a better source than a local museum's history page about one specific type of control cab|date=October 2023}}

=== Gauge ===
[[File:Narrow_gauge_railroad_-_Geriatriezentrum_Lainz_22.jpg|thumb|A narrow gauge train in [[Austria]]]]
Around the world, various [[track gauge]]s are in use for trains. In most cases, trains can only operate on tracks that are of the same gauge; where different gauge trains meet, it is known as a [[break of gauge]]. [[Standard-gauge railway|Standard gauge]], defined as {{convert|4|ft|8.5|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} between the rails, is the most common gauge worldwide, though both [[Broad-gauge railway|broad-gauge]] and [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] trains are also in use.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hilton|first=George W.|date=May 1, 2006|title=A history of track gauge|url=https://www.trains.com/trn/railroads/history/a-history-of-track-gauge/|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Trains|language=en-US}}</ref> Trains also need to fit within the [[loading gauge]] profile to avoid fouling bridges and lineside infrastructure with this being a potential limiting factor on loads such as [[intermodal container]] types that may be carried.<ref name="IRJ">{{cite magazine|last=Burroughs|first=David|date=15 October 2018|title=Network Rail to increase loading gauge on Doncaster – Immingham Line|magazine=International Railway Journal|url-access=limited|access-date=8 November 2021|archive-date=8 November 2021|url=https://www.railjournal.com/infrastructure/network-rail-to-increase-loading-gauge-on-doncaster-immingham-line/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20211108225553/https://www.railjournal.com/infrastructure/network-rail-to-increase-loading-gauge-on-doncaster-immingham-line/}}</ref>

=== Before steam ===
The first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=8}}

=== Steam ===
Steam locomotives work by burning coal, wood or oil fuel in a boiler to heat water into steam, which powers the locomotive's pistons which are in turn connected to the wheels.<ref>{{Cite web|last=McGonigal|first=Robert S.|date=May 1, 2006|title=How a steam locomotive works|url=https://www.trains.com/trn/train-basics/abcs-of-railroading/how-a-steam-locomotive-works/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Trains|language=en-US}}</ref> In the mid 20th century, most steam locomotives were replaced by diesel or electric locomotives, which were cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable.<ref name="anymore">{{Cite web|last=Nilsson|first=Jeff|date=2013-05-11|title=Why You Don't See Steam Locomotives Anymore|url=https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2013/05/locomotive-diesel-engine/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=The Saturday Evening Post|language=en-US}}</ref> Steam locomotives are still used in [[heritage railway]]s operated in many countries for the leisure and enthusiast market.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Minor and Heritage Railways|url=http://orr.gov.uk/about-orr/who-we-work-with/railway-networks/minor-and-heritage-railways|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222044131/http://orr.gov.uk/about-orr/who-we-work-with/railway-networks/minor-and-heritage-railways|archive-date=February 22, 2018|access-date=November 4, 2021|website=orr.gov.uk|publisher=Office of Rail and Road}}</ref>{{globalize-inline|date=October 2023}}

=== Diesel ===
Diesel locomotives are powered with a diesel engine, which generates electricity to drive traction motors. This is known as a [[diesel–electric transmission]], and is used on most larger diesels.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2014|title=Diesel Electric Locomotives|url=https://edisontechcenter.org/Dieseltrains.html|access-date=2021-11-05|website=edisontechcenter.org}}</ref> Diesel power replaced steam for a variety of reasons: diesel locomotives were less complex, far more reliable, cheaper, cleaner, easier to maintain, and more fuel efficient.<ref name="anymore" />

=== Electric ===
[[Image:SwissMGB.jpg|thumbnail|Swiss Electric locomotive at [[Brig, Switzerland]]]]Electric trains receive their current via [[overhead lines]] or through a [[Third rail|third rail electric system]], which is then used to power traction motors that drive the wheels.<ref name="electrification" /> Electric traction offers a lower cost per mile of train operation but at a higher initial cost, which can only be justified on high traffic lines. Even though the cost per mile of construction is much higher, electric traction is cheaper to operate thanks to lower maintenance and purchase costs for locomotives and equipment.<ref name="electrification" /> Compared to diesel locomotives, electric locomotives produce no direct emissions and accelerate much faster, making them better suited to passenger service, especially underground.<ref name="electrification" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Hickman|first=Leo|date=2012-07-16|title=How green are electric trains?|url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/jul/16/electric-trains-diesel-green-carbon|access-date=2021-11-05|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref>

=== Other types ===
[[File:Union_Pacific_third_generation_GTEL_locomotive.JPG|thumb|A [[gas turbine locomotive]] operated by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]]]
{{See also|Alternative fuel locomotive}}
Various other types of train propulsion have been tried, some more successful than others.

In the mid 1900s, [[gas turbine locomotive]]s were developed and successfully used, though most were retired due to high fuel costs and poor reliability.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About Gas Turbine Locomotives|url=http://www.up.com/up/aboutup/special_trains/gas-turbine/index.htm|access-date=2021-11-05|website=www.up.com|language=en}}</ref>

In the 21st century, alternative fuels for locomotives are under development, due to increasing costs for diesel and a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from trains. Examples include [[hydrail]] (trains powered by hydrogen fuel cells) and the use of compressed or [[liquefied natural gas]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Clinnick|first=Robert|date=October 21, 2021|title=Worldwide hydrogen projects gain traction|url=https://www.railjournal.com/in_depth/worldwide-hydrogen-projects-gain-traction/|access-date=2021-11-07|website=International Railway Journal|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Vantuono|first=William C.|date=2021-11-01|title=CP: Green 'Gas 'n Go' Gets Grant|url=https://www.railwayage.com/mechanical/locomotives/cp-green-gas-n-go-gets-grant/|access-date=2021-11-07|website=Railway Age|language=en-US}}</ref>

Railroad cars, also known in {{abbr|CwthE|Commonwealth English}}  as wagons, are unpowered rail vehicles which are typically pulled by locomotives. Many different types exist, specialized to handle various types of cargo. Some common types include [[boxcar]]s (CwthE: [[covered goods wagon]]s) that carry a wide variety of cargo, [[flatcar]]s (CwthE:  [[flat wagon]]s) which have flat tops to hold cargo, [[hopper car]]s which carry bulk commodities, and [[tank car]]s which carry liquids and gases.

== Passenger trains ==
{{Main|Passenger train}}
[[File:Shenzhen_Guangzhou_high_speed_train_new_rolling_stock_China_(37116926035).jpg|thumb|Second-class compartment of a [[China Railways CRH1|China Railways CRH1A-A]] train]]
A passenger train is used to transport people along a railroad line. These trains may consist of unpowered [[passenger railroad car]]s (also known as coaches or carriages) [[push-pull train|hauled]] by one or more locomotives, or may be self-propelled; self propelled passenger trains are known as [[multiple unit]]s or [[railcar]]s. Passenger trains travel between [[train station|stations or depots]], where passengers may board and disembark. In most cases, passenger trains operate on a fixed [[Public transport timetable|schedule]] and have priority over [[freight train]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Freight Delays and Your Amtrak Service|url=https://www.amtrak.com/on-time-performance|access-date=2021-11-05|website=www.amtrak.com|language=en}}</ref> In [[rail transport in Europe|Europe]], passenger trains are assigned to different [[train categories in Europe|train categories]]. 

Passenger trains can be divided into short and long distance services.

=== Long distance trains ===
{{Main|Inter-city rail}}
Long distance passenger trains travel over hundreds or even thousands of miles between cities. The longest passenger train service in the world is Russia's [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] between [[Moscow]] and [[Vladivostok]], a distance of {{convert|5772|mi|km|sp=us|order=flip}}.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Warren|first=Katie|date=January 3, 2020|title=I rode the legendary Trans-Siberian Railway on a 2,000-mile journey across 4 time zones in Russia.

=== Short distance trains ===
Short distance or [[Regional rail|regional]] passenger trains have travel times measured in hours or even minutes, as opposed to days. They run more frequently than long distance trains, and are often used by commuters. Short distance passenger trains specifically designed for commuters are known as [[commuter rail]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Zipper|first=David|date=April 30, 2020|title=Will Commuters Ever Go Back to Commuter Trains?|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-30/will-commuters-ever-go-back-to-commuter-trains|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Bloomberg}}</ref>

=== High speed trains ===
{{Main|High-speed rail}}
[[File:Shinkansen_0series_(4424654951).jpg|thumb|The Japanese [[0 Series Shinkansen]] pioneered high speed rail service]]
The first high speed train was the Japanese [[Shinkansen]], which entered service in 1964.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=134-135}} Since the 1990s, services such as the French [[TGV]] and German [[Intercity Express]] have become competitive with airlines in travel time over short to medium distances.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Bachman|first1=Justin|last2=Fan|first2=Richard|last3=Cannon|first3=Christopher|date=January 9, 2018|title=Watch Out, Airlines.

The lower threshold for the high-speed category is generally {{convert|200|km/h||abbr=off}}. These trains operate at cruising speeds up to {{convert|355|km/h||abbr=off}}.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2025-04-08 |title=High-speed rail {{!}} Definition, History, Technology, Development, & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/high-speed-rail |access-date=2025-04-25 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> Such a speed is incompatible with that of conventional trains, so high speed trains usually run on their own separate tracks – although they may run more slowly when they are deployed on conventional-speed feeder lines on some systems.

"[[Higher speed train]]s" is the category between conventional and high speed trains, which travel at speeds between the two. Examples include the [[Northeast Regional]] (excluding the [[Acela]]) in the United States, the [[Gatimaan Express]] in India, and the [[KTM ETS]] in Malaysia.

=== Luxury trains ===
{{Main|Luxury train}}
Luxury trains provide permium rail services on their journey, either within a given country or across country borders. Some use refurbished classic rail cars.

== Urban rail transit ==
A number of types of trains are used to provide transit to [[urban rail transit|urban areas]]. These are distinct from traditional passenger trains in that they operate more frequently, typically do not share tracks with freight trains, and cover relatively short distances. Many different kinds of systems are in use globally.{{sfn|Herring|2000|p=138-139}}

=== Rapid transit ===
[[Rapid transit]] use trains that operate in tunnels below ground, on [[elevated railway|elevated structures]] like viaducts or bridges above the ground, often on top of city streets or on surface level with an independent alignement from pedestrians or other types of traffic.<ref name="EB-2025">{{cite web |title=Rapid transit |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/rapid-transit |website=www.britannica.com |access-date=16 July 2025 |language=en |date=13 June 2025}}</ref> In many systems, two or even all three of these types may exist on different portions of a network. Alternative terms for these systems are subway, underground, metro, or heavy rail, the latter indicating higher investment costs and passenger loads compared to light rail.

=== Trams ===

[[File:New_Orleans_Streetcar_461_on_Carondelet_Street,_24_August_2021_-_02.jpg|thumb|The [[Streetcars in New Orleans|New Orleans Streetcar System]] is the oldest in the world.]]

{{Main|Tram}}

Trams, also known in North America as streetcars, typically operate on or parallel to streets in cities, with frequent stops and a high frequency of service.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kobie|first=Nicole|date=April 4, 2018|title=Trams are great for city transport – why doesn't the UK have more?|language=en-GB|magazine=Wired UK|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/trams-edinburgh-manchester-uk-transport-system|access-date=2021-11-05|issn=1357-0978}}</ref> Trams emerged in the USA in the 1830s and became popular from the 1860s in Europe and later in other regions as well. Originally tramcars were [[horsecar|pulled by horses]], alternative propulsion like steam power and cables gained success until the arrival of electric trams.<ref name="LRTA-1998">{{cite web |title=History of Light Rail |url=https://lrta.info/archive/mrthistory.html |website=lrta.info |access-date=16 July 2025}}</ref> Since the 1990s low-floor trams have become common.

=== Light rail ===

[[File:Zoetermeer Station Centrum West (cropped).JPG|thumb|[[RegioCitadis]] light rail train in [[Zoetermeer|Zoetermeer (the Netherlands)]].]]

{{Main|Light rail}}

Light rail is a umbrella term for a variety of systems, which use tram technology, but with more separate right-of-ways and often a longer distance between stops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Streetcars vs Light Rail ...

While they have long been important in transporting troops and military equipment, trains have occasionally been used for direct combat. Armored trains have been used in a number of conflicts, as have railroad based artillery systems.<ref>{{Cite web|date=October 18, 2015|title=These are the incredible armored trains of World War I and World War II|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/these-armored-trains-of-world-wars-i-and-ii-2014-11|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Business Insider|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Harrison|first=Scott|date=2019-06-11|title=From the Archives: 14-inch railroad guns fired near Oceanside|url=https://www.latimes.com/visuals/photography/la-me-fw-archives-14-inch-railroad-guns-fired-near-oceanside-20190516-htmlstory.html|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Railcar-launched ICBM]] systems have also been used by nuclear weapon states.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mizokami|first=Kyle|date=2017-02-27|title=All Aboard Russia's Nuclear Weapon Apocalypse Train|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a25423/all-aboard-russias-apocalypse-train/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Popular Mechanics|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Rack railway ===
{{Main|Rack railway}}
For climbing steep slopes, specialized rack railroads are used. In order to avoid slipping, a [[rack and pinion]] system is used, with a toothed rail placed between the two regular rails, which meshes with a drive gear under the locomotive.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Fred|last2=Frick|first2=Martin R.|date=May 24, 1976|title=The Pike's Peak Cog Railway Colorado Springs, Colorado: A National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark|url=https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/16-manitou-and-pikes-peak-cog-railway.pdf|access-date=November 5, 2021|website=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}}</ref>

=== Funicular ===
{{Main|Funicular}}
Funiculars are also used to climb steep slopes, but instead of a rack use a rope, which is attached to two cars and a pulley.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What Is a Funicular Railway|url=https://ridetheincline.com/what-is-a-funicular-railway/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=Incline Railway|language=en-US}}</ref> The two funicular cars travel up and down the slope on parallel sets of rails when the pulley is rotated. This design makes funiculars an efficient means of moving people and cargo up and down slopes.<ref name="funiculars">{{Cite web|last=Harley-Trochimczyk|first=Anna|date=July 7, 2009|title=The Fun of Funiculars|url=https://illumin.usc.edu/the-fun-of-funiculars/|access-date=2021-11-05|website=USC Viterbi School of Engineering|language=en-US}}</ref> The earliest funicular railroad, the [[Reisszug]], opened around 1500.<ref name="funiculars" />

=== Rubber-tired train ===
{{Main articles|Rubber-tyred metro|Rubber-tyred tram}}
Rubber tire trains, or rubber-tired metro systems, employ rubber tires for traction and guidance, offering advantages like better acceleration and reduced noise. However, they come with disadvantages, including higher costs for installation and maintenance, faster tire wear, and complex tire inflation mechanisms that require regular upkeep. Nonetheless, these systems are utilized in many urban rapid transit networks worldwide, enhancing passenger comfort and urban transportation efficiency.

Under the right circumstances, transporting freight by train is less expensive than other modes of transport, and also more energy efficient than transporting freight by road. In the United States, railroads on average moved a ton of freight {{convert|436|mi|km|sp=us|order=flip}} per gallon of fuel, as of 2008, an efficiency four times greater than that of trucks.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jackson|first=Brooks|date=2008-07-01|title=Fuel Efficient Freight Trains?|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2008/07/fuel-efficient-freight-trains/|access-date=2021-11-01|website=FactCheck.org|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="freight">{{Cite web|title=Freight Rail Overview {{!}} FRA|url=https://railroads.dot.gov/rail-network-development/freight-rail-overview|access-date=2021-11-01|website=railroads.dot.gov}}</ref> The [[Environmental and Energy Study Institute]] estimates that train transportation of freight is between 1.9 and 5.5 times more efficient than by truck, and also generates significantly less pollution.<ref name="electrification">{{Cite web|last=Nunno|first=Richard|date=May 30, 2018|title=Electrification of U.S. Railways: Pie in the Sky, or Realistic Goal? {{!}} Article {{!}} EESI|url=https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/electrification-of-u.s.-railways-pie-in-the-sky-or-realistic-goal|access-date=2021-11-01|website=www.eesi.org}}</ref> Rail freight is most economic when goods are being carried in bulk and over large distances, but it is less suited to short distances and small loads.<ref name="freight" /> With the advent of [[containerization]], freight rail has become part of an [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal freight network]] linked with trucking and [[container ship]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stagl|first=Jeff|date=June 2008|title=Rail Insider-From dieselization to computerization to consolidation, freight railroads have made industry-shaping strides|url=https://www.progressiverailroading.com/federal_legislation_regulation/article/From-dieselization-to-computerization-to-consolidation-freight-railroads-have-made-industry-shaping-strides--17007|access-date=2021-11-06|website=Progressive Railroading|language=en}}</ref>

The main disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility and for this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to [[road transport|road competition]]. Many governments are trying to encourage more freight back on to trains because of the community benefits that it would bring.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017|title=Benefits of using Rail Freight|url=https://www.transport.gov.scot/media/33630/transport-scotland-rail-freight-guide-web.pdf|access-date=November 5, 2021|website=Transport Scotland}}</ref>

From the dawn of railroading, trains have had a significant cultural impact worldwide. Fast train travel made possible in days or hours journeys which previously took months.
