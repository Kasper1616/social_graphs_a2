'''Cake''' is a [[Confectionery#Baker's confectionery|baker's confectionery ]] usually made from [[flour]], sugar, and other ingredients and is usually [[baking|baked]]. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of [[bread]], but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate and which share features with [[Dessert|desserts]] such as [[pastry|pastries]], [[meringue]]s, [[custard]]s, and [[pie]]s.

The most common ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, fat (such as [[butter]], [[Vegetable oil|oil]], or [[margarine]]), a liquid, and a [[leavening agent]], such as [[baking soda]] or [[baking powder]]. Common additional ingredients include [[Dried fruit|dried]], [[candied fruit|candied]], or fresh fruit, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[cocoa powder|cocoa]], and [[extract]]s such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with [[fruit preserves]], nuts, or dessert sauces (like [[custard]], [[Fruit preserves|jelly]], cooked [[fruit]], [[whipped cream]], or [[syrup]]s),<ref>{{cite web |title=Cake Filling Types |url=https://www.recipetips.com/kitchen-tips/t--1648/cake-filling-types.asp |date=2022<!--from page source--> |website=RecipeTips |access-date=8 May 2022 |archive-date=2 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220702195438/https://www.recipetips.com/kitchen-tips/t--1648/cake-filling-types.asp |url-status=live }}</ref> iced with [[buttercream]] or other [[Icing (food)|icings]], and decorated with [[marzipan]], piped borders, or candied fruit.

Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, [[Anniversary|anniversaries]], and birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the [[whisk]]ing of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.

==History==
The term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of [[Viking]] origin, from the [[Old Norse]] word "kaka".<ref>[http://www.devlaming.co.za/the-history-of-cakes The history of cakes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829064810/http://www.devlaming.co.za/the-history-of-cakes |date=29 August 2014 }}. Devlaming.co.za. Retrieved 23 December 2011.</ref>

The ancient Greeks called cake πλακοῦς (''plakous''), which was derived from the word for "flat", πλακόεις (''plakoeis''). It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. They also had a cake called "satura", which was a flat, heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake became "placenta", which was derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a pastry case.<ref>{{cite web|title=whatscookingamerica.net|date=June 2016|url=https://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CakeHistory.htm|access-date=16 December 2016|archive-date=6 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406061335/https://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CakeHistory.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Greeks invented beer as a [[leavening agent|leavener]], [[frying]] [[fritter]]s in [[olive oil]], and [[cheesecake]]s using [[goat's milk]].<ref>Castella, Krystina (2010). ''A World of Cake: 150 Recipes for Sweet Traditions From Cultures Around the World'', pp. 3–4. {{ISBN|978-1-60342-576-6}}.</ref> In [[ancient Rome]], the basic bread dough was sometimes enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, which produced a sweet and cake-like baked good.<ref name="isbn0-19-280352-2">{{cite book |title=An A–Z of food and drink |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-19-280352-2 |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |author=Ayto, John |url=https://archive.org/details/azoffooddrink00ayto }}</ref> The [[Latin]] poet [[Ovid]] refers to his and his brother's birthday party and cake in his first book of exile, ''[[Tristia]]''.<ref>Ov. ''Tris''. IV. X:12.</ref>

Early 14th century cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a "cake" and "bread" were the round, flat shape of the cakes and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while cooking, while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.<ref name="isbn0-19-280352-2" />

[[Sponge cake]]s, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during [[the Renaissance]], possibly in [[Spain]].<ref>Castella, Krystina (2010). ''A World of Cake: 150 Recipes for Sweet Traditions From Cultures Around the World'', pp. 6–7. {{ISBN|978-1-60342-576-6}}.</ref>

===Cake mixes===
{{main|Baking mix}}
[[File:Cake mix in plastic packet photo.JPG|thumb|[[Baking mix|Cake mix]] in plastic packets]]
During the [[Great Depression]], there was a surplus of [[molasses]] and the need to provide easily made food to millions of economically depressed people in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/pop-culture/article/cake-mix-history |title=A History of the Cake Mix, the Invention That Redefined 'Baking' |last=Park |first=Michael |website=bonappetit.com |publisher=Bon Appétit |date=2013 |access-date=25 May 2014 |archive-date=25 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025080936/https://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/pop-culture/article/cake-mix-history |url-status=live }}</ref> One company patented a cake-bread mix to deal with this economic situation and thereby established the first line of cake in a box. In doing so, cake, as it is known today, became a [[mass production|mass-produced]] good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty.

Later, during the [[post-war boom]], other American companies (notably [[General Mills]]) developed this idea further, marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience, especially to housewives. When sales dropped heavily in the 1950s, marketers discovered that baking cakes, once a task at which housewives could exercise skill and creativity, had become dispiriting. This was a period in American ideological history when women, retired from the war-time labor force, were confined to the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] while still exposed to the blossoming consumerism in the US.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Catalano |first=Christina |year=2002 |title=Shaping the American Woman: Feminism and Advertising in the 1950s |url=http://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&context=constructing |journal=Constructing the Past |volume=3 |issue=1 |page=45 |access-date=25 May 2014 |archive-date=27 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211127021616/https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&context=constructing |url-status=live }}</ref> This inspired [[psychologist]] [[Ernest Dichter]] to find a solution to the cake mix problem in the [[icing (food)|frosting]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/cakemix.asp |title=Something Eggstra |website=Snopes.com |date=31 January 2008 |access-date=25 May 2014 |archive-date=5 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211205152008/https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/something-eggstra/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Since making the cake was so simple, housewives and other in-home cake makers could expend their creative energy on [[cake decorating]] inspired by, among other things, photographs in magazines of elaborately decorated cakes.

Ever since boxed cake mix has become a staple of supermarkets, it is often complemented with frosting in a can.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

==Varieties==
{{Main|List of cakes}}

Cakes are broadly divided into several categories, based primarily on ingredients and mixing techniques. There are about ''hundreds'' of different types of cakes, but there are '''two''' broad categories, that [[culinary]] divide them into: ''shortened,'' and ''unshorted cakes.'' Unshortened cakes contain no fat while ''shortened cakes'' do. These types may be combined in [[baking]].

Although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise classification has always been elusive.<ref name="isbn0-19-280352-2" />

===Butter cake===
{{main|Butter cake}}
[[File:182365 Gooey Butter Cake.jpg|thumb|[[Gooey butter cake]]]]
[[Butter cake]]s are made from creamed butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They rely on the combination of butter and sugar beaten for an extended time to incorporate air into the batter.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robbins |first1=Mary Jane |title=Creaming butter and sugar |url=http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2015/04/27/creaming-butter-sugar/ |website=King Arthur Flour |access-date=6 December 2015 |archive-date=14 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200614084744/https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2015/04/27/creaming-butter-sugar |url-status=live }}</ref> A classic [[pound cake]] is made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Another type of butter cake that takes its name from the proportion of ingredients used is [[1-2-3-4 cake]]: {{cups|1|US}} butter, {{cups|2|US}} sugar, {{cups|3|US}} flour, and 4 eggs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Classic 1-2-3-4 Cake and Variations |website=The Spruce Eats |url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/classic-1234-cake-and-variations-3062322 |access-date=28 December 2020 |archive-date=26 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210926082728/https://www.thespruceeats.com/classic-1234-cake-and-variations-3062322 |url-status=live }}</ref> According to Beth Tartan, this cake was one of the most common among the [[American pioneer]]s who settled North Carolina.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tartan |first=Beth |title=North Carolina and Old Salem Cookery |year=1992 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=9780807843758 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jhd6x_rrkPwC&dq=1-2-3-4+cake&pg=PA257 |access-date=19 November 2021 |archive-date=16 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231216162512/https://books.google.com/books?id=jhd6x_rrkPwC&dq=1-2-3-4+cake&pg=PA257#v=onepage&q=1-2-3-4%20cake&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{main|Sponge cake}}
[[File:HK Sheung Wan 寶湖金宴 Treasure Lake Seafood Restaurant food Chinese Steamed Sponge Cake 馬拉糕 Mah Lai Goh Jan-2013.JPG|thumb|Steamed sponge cake called ''ma lai gao'']]
[[Sponge cake]]s (or foam cakes) are made from whipped eggs, sugar, and flour. Traditional sponge cakes are leavened only with eggs. They rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally beaten eggs) to provide [[leavening]], sometimes with a bit of [[baking powder]] or other chemical leaven added. Egg-leavened sponge cakes are thought to be the oldest cakes made without yeast.

[[Angel food cake]] is a [[white cake]] that uses only the whites of the eggs and is traditionally baked in a tube pan. The French [[Génoise cake|Génoise]] is a sponge cake that includes [[clarified butter]]. Highly decorated sponge cakes with lavish toppings are sometimes called ''gateau'', the French word for cake. [[Chiffon cake]]s are sponge cakes with vegetable oil, which adds moistness.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Medrich |first1=Alice |title=Joy of Cooking |date=1997 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=0-684-81870-1 |page=949}}</ref>

===Chocolate cake===

[[File:GermanChocolateCake.jpg|thumb|[[German chocolate cake]]]]
[[Chocolate cake]]s are butter cakes, sponge cakes, or other cakes flavored with melted chocolate or [[Cocoa solids|cocoa powder]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Berry |first1=Mary |title=Chocolate sponge cake |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chocolate_cake_48307 |access-date=6 December 2015 |work=Food: Recipes |publisher=BBC |archive-date=22 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422041523/https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chocolate_cake_48307 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[German chocolate cake]] is a variety of chocolate cake.

===Coffee cake===
{{main|Coffee cake (American)}}
[[Coffee cake (American)|Coffee cake]] is generally thought of as a cake to serve with coffee or tea at breakfast or a [[coffee break]]. Some types use yeast as a leavening agent, while others use baking soda or baking powder. These cakes often have a crumb topping called [[streusel]] or a light glaze drizzle.

===Flourless cake===
Baked flourless cakes include [[Clementine cake|clementine cakes]], baked [[cheesecake]]s, and [[flourless chocolate cake]]s.

===Layer cakes===
{{main|Layer cake}}
[[Layer cake|Layer cakes]] are cakes made of stacked layers of sponge or butter cake filled with cream, jam, or other filling in between the layers to hold them together.

===One-egg cake===
One-egg cakes are made with one egg. They can be made with butter<ref>{{cite book |last=Farmer |first=Fannie Merritt |title=The Boston Cooking-school Cook Book |year=1896 |page=420 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1H8EAAAAYAAJ&dq=One+egg+cake&pg=PA420 |access-date=19 November 2021 |archive-date=16 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231216162512/https://books.google.com/books?id=1H8EAAAAYAAJ&dq=One+egg+cake&pg=PA420#v=onepage&q=One%20egg%20cake&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> or vegetable shortening.<ref>{{cite book |last=Berolzheimer |first=Ruth |title=Culinary Arts Institute Encyclopedic Cookbook |date=1948 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780399513886 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eoktyOUwM1oC&dq=One+egg+cake&pg=PA690 |access-date=19 November 2021 |archive-date=16 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231216162512/https://books.google.com/books?id=eoktyOUwM1oC&dq=One+egg+cake&pg=PA690#v=onepage&q=One%20egg%20cake&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref> One egg cake was an economical recipe when using two eggs for each cake was too costly.<ref>{{cite book |title=Good Housekeeping Volume 71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGwjAQAAMAAJ&dq=One+egg+cake&pg=RA2-PA51 |date=1920 |access-date=19 November 2021 |archive-date=16 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231216162512/https://books.google.com/books?id=UGwjAQAAMAAJ&dq=One+egg+cake&pg=RA2-PA51#v=onepage&q=One%20egg%20cake&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Comparison with bread ==
Although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise classification has always been elusive.<ref name="isbn0-19-280352-2" /> For example, [[banana bread]] may be properly considered either a [[quick bread]] or a cake. [[Yeast]] cakes are the oldest and are very similar to yeast bread. Such cakes are often very traditional in form and include such as [[babka (food)|babka]], a [[Viennoiserie]], and [[stollen]].

==Special-purpose cakes==
Cakes may be classified according to the occasion for which they are intended. For example, [[wedding cake]]s, [[birthday cake]]s, cakes for [[first communion]], Christmas cakes, [[Halloween]] cakes, and [[Passover]] plava (a type of sponge cake sometimes made with [[Matzah|matzo]] meal) are all identified primarily according to the celebration they are intended to accompany. The cutting of a wedding cake constitutes a social ceremony in some cultures. The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of {{lang|la|[[confarreatio]]}} originated in the sharing of a cake.

Particular types of cake may be associated with particular festivals, such as [[stollen]] or [[Bûche de Noël|chocolate log]] (at Christmas), [[babka (food)|babka]] and [[simnel cake]] (at Easter), or [[mooncake]]. There has been a long tradition of decorating an iced cake at Christmas time; other cakes associated with Christmas include chocolate log and [[mince pies]].

A Lancashire Courting Cake is a fruit-filled cake baked by a fiancée for her betrothed. The cake has been described as "somewhere between a firm sponge – with a greater proportion of flour to fat and eggs than a Victoria sponge cake – and a shortbread base and was proof of the bride-to-be's baking skills".  Traditionally it is a two-layer cake filled and topped with strawberries or raspberries and whipped cream.<ref name="Lancashire Life">{{cite web |url=http://www.lancashirelife.co.uk/food-drink/the_history_of_the_courting_cake_a_lancashire_tradition_1_1645135 |title=The history of the Courting Cake, a Lancashire tradition |publisher=Lancashire Life |access-date=9 October 2015 |date=1 June 2011 |archive-date=23 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223125758/http://www.lancashirelife.co.uk/food-drink/the_history_of_the_courting_cake_a_lancashire_tradition_1_1645135 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Sometimes a cake is made less for its value as food, and more for its value as a [[novelty]].  That includes the [[pop out cake]], which is usually a large cardboard box, covered with cake or at least frosting.  A person hides inside the box and jumps out as a surprise.  A [[cake dress]] is a wearable [[dress]] that is made mostly out of cake (e.g., cake stacked on shelves attached to a [[crinoline]] skirt).

==Shapes==
[[File:Chocolate Sour Cream Bundt Cake, March 2008.jpg|thumb|A chocolate sour cream [[bundt cake]]]]
Cakes are frequently described according to their physical form. Cakes may be small and intended for individual consumption. Larger cakes may be made to be sliced and served as part of a meal or social function. Common shapes include:
* [[Bundt cake]]s and [[angel food cake]]
* [[Cake balls]]
* [[Cake pop]]s
* [[Cone (geometry)|Conical]], such as the [[Kransekake]]
* [[Cupcake]]s and [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleines]], which are both sized for a single person
* [[Layer cake]]s, with at least two stacked layers, frequently filled and decorated
* [[Sheet cake]]s, simple, flat, rectangular cakes baked in [[sheet pan]]s
* [[Spit cake]], a tubular cake
* [[Swiss roll]]s

==Flour==
{{Main|Flour}}
In the US, special cake flour is available, which has a high starch-to-gluten ratio that is made from fine-textured, soft, low-protein wheat. It is strongly bleached and compared to all-purpose flour, and cake flour tends to result in cakes with a lighter, less dense texture.<ref>[http://whatscookingamerica.net/Bread/FlourTypes.htm Types of Flour] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518234708/http://whatscookingamerica.net/Bread/FlourTypes.htm |date=18 May 2011 }}.

==Cake decorating==
{{main|Cake decorating}}
[[File:Piping buttercream onto cake.JPG|thumb|[[Cake decorating|Cake decoration]] – [[buttercream]] swirls being piped onto the sides of this cake with a [[pastry bag]]]]
A finished cake is often enhanced by covering it with [[Icing (food)|icing]], or frosting, and toppings such as [[sprinkles]], which are also known as "jimmies" in certain parts of the United States and "hundreds and thousands" in the United Kingdom. The frosting is usually made from powdered (icing) sugar, sometimes a fat of some sort, milk or cream, and often flavorings such as a [[Vanilla|vanilla extract]] or [[Chocolate|cocoa powder]]. Some decorators use a rolled [[fondant icing]]. Commercial bakeries tend to use [[lard]] for the fat, and often whip the lard to introduce air bubbles. This makes the icing light and spreadable. Home bakers either use lard, butter, [[margarine]], or some combination thereof. Sprinkles are small firm pieces of sugar and oils that are colored with [[food coloring]]. In the late 20th century, new cake decorating products became available to the public. These include several specialized sprinkles and even methods to print pictures and transfer the image onto a cake.

Special tools are needed for more complex [[cake decorating]], such as [[pastry bag|piping bags]] and various piping tips, syringes and [[embossing mat]]s. To use a piping bag or syringe, a piping tip is attached to the bag or syringe using a coupler. The bag or syringe is partially filled with icing which is sometimes colored. Using different piping tips and various techniques, a cake decorator can make many different designs. Basic decorating tips include open star, closed star, basketweave, round, drop flower, leaf, multi, petal, and specialty tips. An embossing mat is used to create embossed effects. A [[cake turntable]] that cakes are spun upon may be used in cake decoration.

[[Royal icing]], [[marzipan]] (or a less sweet version, known as [[almond paste]]), fondant icing
(also known as sugar paste), and buttercream are used as covering icings and to create decorations. Floral [[sugarcraft]] or wired sugar flowers are an important part of cake decoration. Cakes for special occasions, such as wedding cakes, are traditionally rich fruit cakes or occasionally [[Madeira cake]]s, that are covered with marzipan and iced using royal icing or sugar-paste. They are finished with piped borders (made with royal icing) and adorned with a piped message, wired sugar flowers, hand-formed fondant flowers, marzipan fruit, piped flowers, or crystallized fruits or flowers such as [[grapes]] or [[Viola (plant)|violets]].

==Food safety==

The shelf life of cakes packages for commercial sale depends on several factors. Cakes are intermediate moisture products prone to mold growth. Commercial cakes are frequently and commonly exposed to different mold varieties before they are packaged for sale, including ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and various [[penicillin]]s, and ''[[Aspergillus niger]]''. Preservatives and oxygen absorbents are currently used to control and inhibit mold growth.

The CDC has recommended not to eat raw cake batter because it can contain pathogens like ''[[Salmonella]]'' and ''[[E. coli]]''.  Cake batter uses raw flour which can contain live bacteria and present a hazard if consumed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Raw Dough Can Contain Germs That Make You Sick |website=CDC |date=28 July 2021 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/no-raw-dough.html |access-date=21 October 2021 |archive-date=17 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211217011323/https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/no-raw-dough.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
