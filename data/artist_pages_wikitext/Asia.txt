Asia shares the [[landmass]] of [[Eurasia]] with [[Europe]], and of [[Afro-Eurasia]] with both Europe and [[Africa]]. In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]], and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The border of Asia with Europe is a [[social constructionism|historical and cultural construct]], as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] separating it from Africa; and to the east of the [[Turkish straits]], the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Ural River]], and to the south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas, separating it from Europe.<ref name="National Geographic-1999">{{cite book |title=National Geographic Atlas of the World |edition=7th |year=1999 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} "Europe" (pp. 68–69); "Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."</ref>

Since the concept of Asia derives from the term for the eastern region from a European perspective, Asia is the remaining vast area of Eurasia minus Europe. Therefore, Asia is a region where various independent cultures coexist rather than sharing a single culture, and its boundary with Europe is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]]. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East–West]] cultural differences, some of which vary on a spectrum.

[[China]] and [[India]] traded places as the [[list of regions by past GDP (PPP)|largest economies in the world]] from 1 to 1800 CE.

Asia varies greatly across and within [[Regions of Asia|its regions]] with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties, and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot deserts in parts of [[West Asia]], [[Central Asia]] and [[South Asia]], temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in [[North Asia]].

The term "Asia" is believed to originate in the [[Bronze Age]] toponym {{tlit|hit|[[Assuwa]]}} ({{langx|hit|𒀸𒋗𒉿|translit=aš-šu-wa|link=yes}}) which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern [[Anatolia]].

Herodotus used the term in reference to [[Anatolia]] and the territory of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], in contrast to Greece and Egypt.

In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] published a new atlas proposing the Ural Mountains as the border of Asia. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the [[Emba River]] as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the [[Ural River]] prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=27–28}}.</ref> The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the [[Caucasus Mountains]], although it is sometimes placed further north.<ref name="Lineback-2013" />

The border between Asia and [[Oceania]] is usually placed somewhere in the [[Indonesian Archipelago]], specifically in [[Eastern Indonesia]]. The [[Wallace Line]] separates the Asian and [[Wallacea]] biogeographical realms, a transition zone of deep water straits between the Asian and Australian continental shelves. [[Weber's Line]] split the region in two with regard to the balance of fauna between Asian origin or Australo-Papuan origin.<ref name="Simpson-1977"/> Wallacea's eastern boundary with [[Australia (continent)|Sahul]] is represented by the [[Richard Lydekker|Lydekker's Line]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Islands under the sea: a review of early modern human dispersal routes and migration hypotheses through Wallacea |journal=The Journal of Island and Coastal Archaeology |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=364–384 |year=2015 |doi=10.1080/15564894.2015.1119218 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287798057 |last1=Kealy |first1=Shimona |last2=Louys |first2=Julien |last3=o'Connor |first3=Sue |s2cid=129964987 |issn=1556-4894}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=New |first=T.

The Aleutian Islands are sometimes associated with Oceania, owing to their status as remote Pacific islands, and their proximity to the Pacific Plate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Danver |first1=Steven L. |title=Native Peoples of the World: An Encyclopedia of Groups, Cultures and Contemporary Issues |date=2015 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=185 |isbn=978-1317464006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vf4TBwAAQBAJ&dq=%22aleutians%22+%22part+of+oceania%22&pg=PA185 |access-date=23 April 2022 |archive-date=4 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404181817/https://books.google.com/books?id=vf4TBwAAQBAJ&dq=%22aleutians%22+%22part+of+oceania%22&pg=PA185 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Wallace |first1=Alfred Russel |title=Australasia |date=1879 |publisher=University of Michigan |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2kcAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22oceania+is+the+word+often%22&pg=PA2 |access-date=12 March 2022 |quote=The more northerly section, lying between Japan and California and between the Aleutian and Hawaiian Archipelagos is relived by nothing but a few solitary reefs and rocks at enormously distant intervals. |archive-date=30 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220730064236/https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Australasia/e2kcAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22oceania+is+the+word+often%22&pg=PA2&printsec=frontcover |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Kohlhoff |first1=Dean |title=Amchitka and the Bomb: Nuclear Testing in Alaska |date=2002 |publisher=University of Washington Press |page=6 |isbn=978-0295800509 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kSWn8lbI4q4C&dq=%22aleutian+islands%22+%22oceania%22&pg=PA6 |access-date=12 March 2022 |quote=The regional name of the Pacific Islands is appropriate: Oceania, a sea of islands, including those of Alaska and Hawaii.

Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of [[Eurasia]] with Europe being a northwestern [[peninsula]] of the landmass. Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—[[Afro-Eurasia]]—and share a common [[continental shelf]]. Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the [[Eurasian Plate]], adjoined on the south by the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian Plate]] and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the [[Chersky Range]]) on the [[North American Plate]].

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilisations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilisations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Yellow River]] shared many similarities. These civilisations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the [[wheel]]. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the [[steppe]]s. The earliest postulated [[Indo-European migrations|expansion]] out of the steppe is that of the [[Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into West Asia, South Asia, and the borders of China,<ref name="Narasimhan_2019"/> where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated.

The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe horsemen]] could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the [[Nomadic empire|mounted hordes]] of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large equestrian force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

[[File:Himalayas.jpg|thumb|The [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.]]
Asia is the largest continent on Earth. It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at {{convert|62800|km|mi|0}}. Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]]) and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.<ref name="National Geographic-1999" /><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Asia |url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online |year=2006 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118141016/https://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia |archive-date=18 November 2008}}</ref> It is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkey]]) are [[transcontinental countries]] lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|European nation]], both [[Russian culture|culturally]] and politically.

The [[Gobi Desert]] is in Mongolia and the [[Arabian Desert]] stretches across much of the Middle East. The [[Yangtze]] in China is the longest river in the continent. The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. [[Tropical rainforest]]s stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and [[deciduous]] forests lie farther north.

There are various approaches to the regional division of Asia. The following subdivision into regions is used, among others, by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD). This division of Asia into regions by the United Nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories.<ref>{{cite web |title=Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use (M49 Standard) |publisher=UN Statistics Division |url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/ |access-date=2 May 2020 |archive-date=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830170949/https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/ |url-status=live}} "Geographic Regions" anklicken Zitat: "The assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories by the United Nations."</ref>

Asia has extremely diverse climate features. Climates range from [[Arctic]] and [[subarctic]] in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The [[monsoon]] circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for [[tropical cyclone]] activity lies northeast of the [[Philippines]] and south of Japan.

(NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) or [[APEC]]). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy.

Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as [[petroleum]], [[forest]]s, [[fish]], [[water]], [[rice]], [[copper]] and [[silver]]. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, [[Taiwan]], South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of [[multinational corporation]]s, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Fairless |first=Tom |title=Rich Countries Are Becoming Addicted to Cheap Labor |url=https://www.wsj.com/economy/business-immigrant-low-skilled-labor-addiction-bf009a83 |access-date=4 June 2024 |work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Global firms are eyeing Asian alternatives to Chinese manufacturing |url=https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/20/global-firms-are-eyeing-asian-alternatives-to-chinese-manufacturing |access-date=4 June 2024 |newspaper=The Economist}}</ref>

Trade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia. Individual main routes have emerged from this. The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the [[Strait of Malacca]] via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Malé to East Africa [[Mombasa]] (see also: [[Indo-Pacific]]), from there to [[Djibouti]], then through the Red Sea over the [[Suez Canal]] into Mediterranean (see also: [[Indo-Mediterranean]]), there via Haifa, Istanbul and [[Athens]] to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of [[Trieste]] with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to [[Barcelona]] and around Spain and France to the European northern ports. A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via [[Cape Route|South Africa to Europe]]. A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out on the [[Pacific Rim]], toward [[Los Angeles]] and [[Long Beach]].

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Asia}}
Asia is home to several [[language families]] and many [[language isolate]]s. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to [[Ethnologue]], more than 700 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 400 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

=== Religions ===
{{See also|Eastern philosophy|Religion in Asia|List of Asian mythologies}}
Many of the world's [[major religions]] have their origins in Asia, including the five most practiced in the world (excluding [[irreligion]]), which are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Chinese folk religion (classified as Confucianism and Taoism), and Buddhism. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the [[Great Flood]] for example, as presented to Jews in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the narrative of [[Noah]]—and later to Christians in the [[Old Testament]], and to Muslims in the [[Quran]]—is earliest found in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], in the [[Enûma Eliš]] and ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. [[Hindu mythology]] similarly tells about an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] in the form of a [[Matsya|fish]] who warned [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] of a terrible flood. Ancient [[Chinese mythology]] also tells of a [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control.

Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. [[Indian philosophy]] includes [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, [[Cārvāka]], preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Zen]] Buddhism took shape.

{{as of|2012}}, Hinduism has around 1.1&nbsp;billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and [[Bali]], Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

[[Sikhism]] is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia. [[Confucianism]] is found predominantly in mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations. [[Taoism]] is found mainly in mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. In many Chinese communities, Taoism is easily syncretised with [[Mahayana Buddhism]], thus exact religious statistics are difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Asia}}

The [[culture of Asia]] is a diverse blend of customs and traditions that have been practiced by the various ethnic groups of the continent for centuries. The continent is divided into six geographic sub-regions: [[Central Asia]], [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asia]], [[North Asia]], [[South Asian ethnic groups|South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and [[West Asia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/ |title=Geographic Regions |publisher=United Nations |access-date=31 March 2018 |archive-date=30 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830170949/https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/ |url-status=live}}</ref> These regions are defined by their cultural similarities, including common religions, languages, and ethnicities. West Asia, also known as Southwest Asia or the [[Middle East]], has cultural roots in the ancient civilisations of the [[Fertile Crescent]] and [[Mesopotamia]], which gave rise to the [[Iran|Persian]], [[Arab world|Arab]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires, as well as the Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Collon |first=Dominique |title=BBC – History – Ancient History in depth: Mesopotamia |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/mesopotamia_gallery.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230102042221/https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/cultures/mesopotamia_gallery.shtml |archive-date=2 January 2023 |access-date=31 March 2018}}</ref> These civilisations, which are located in the [[Hilly flanks]], are among the oldest in the world, with evidence of farming dating back to around 9000&nbsp;BCE.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morris |first=Ian |title=Why the West rules – for now: the patterns of history, and what they reveal about the future |date=2011 |publisher=Profile |isbn=978-1846682087 |oclc=751789199}}</ref> Despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges, trade and commerce have helped to create a [[Pan-Asian]] culture that is shared across the region.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTEeCgAAQBAJ&q=Indianized+kingdoms&pg=PA299 |title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions, Volume I: To 1500: A Global History |date=19 June 2014 |access-date=31 March 2018 |isbn=978-1285783086 |last1=Lockard |first1=Craig A. |publisher=Cengage |archive-date=26 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326205006/https://books.google.com/books?id=lTEeCgAAQBAJ&q=Indianized+kingdoms&pg=PA299 |url-status=live}}</ref>
