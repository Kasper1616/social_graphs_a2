A '''starship''', '''starcraft''', or '''interstellar spacecraft''' is a theoretical [[spacecraft]] designed for [[interstellar travel|traveling between planetary systems]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com|title=What Would a Actually Look Like?|publisher=Popularmechanics|language=en|author=Erik Sofge|date=20 September 2012|access-date=9 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010713000027/http://www.yahoo.com/|archive-date=13 July 2001|url-status=live}}</ref> The term is mostly found in [[science fiction]].

While [[NASA]]'s ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' and ''[[Pioneer program|Pioneer]]'' probes have traveled into local interstellar space, the purpose of these uncrewed craft was specifically interplanetary, and they are not predicted to reach another star system; ''[[Voyager 1]]'' probe and [[Gliese 445]] will pass one another within 1.6 [[light year]]s in about 40,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/22783-voyager-1-interstellar-space-star-flyby.html|title=Voyager 1 Has Date with a Star in 40,000 Years|work=Space.com|date=13 September 2013 |access-date=2015-07-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724115732/http://www.space.com/22783-voyager-1-interstellar-space-star-flyby.html|archive-date=2015-07-24|url-status=live}}</ref> Several preliminary designs for starships have been undertaken through [[exploratory engineering]], using [[feasibility study|feasibility studies]] with modern technology or technology thought likely to be available in the near future.

==Research==
[[File:Daedalus Spaceship concept.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's conception of British Interplanetary Society's [[Project Daedalus]] (1978), a fusion powered interstellar probe]]
To travel between stars in a reasonable time using [[rocket]]-like technology requires very high [[effective exhaust velocity]] jet and enormous energy to power this, such as might be provided by [[fusion power]] or [[antimatter]].

There are very few scientific studies that investigate the issues in building a starship. Some examples of this include:

*[[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] (1958–1965), mostly crewed interplanetary spacecraft
*[[Project Daedalus]] (1973–1978), uncrewed interstellar probe
*[[Project Longshot]] (1987–1988), uncrewed interstellar probe
*[[Project Icarus (Interstellar Probe Design Study)|Project Icarus]] (2009–2014), uncrewed interstellar probe
*[[Hundred-Year Starship]] (2011), crewed interstellar craft<!--DARPA study-->

The [[Bussard ramjet]] is an idea to use nuclear fusion of [[interstellar gas]] to provide propulsion.

Examined in an October 1973 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'', the [[Enzmann Starship]] proposed using a 12,000-ton ball of frozen [[deuterium]] to power pulse propulsion units. Twice as long as the [[Empire State Building]] is tall and assembled in-orbit, the proposed spacecraft would be part of a larger project preceded by [[interstellar probe]]s and telescopic observation of target star systems.

The NASA [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] (1996–2002) was a professional scientific study examining advanced [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems.

==Types==
* [[Sleeper ship|Sleeper]]: Starships that place their occupants into [[Cryostasis (clathrate hydrates)|Cryostasis]] or [[Stasis (fiction)|Temporal Stasis]] during a long trip. This includes [[cryonics]]-based systems that freeze passengers for the duration of the journey. This is a common trope in science fiction, with some notable examples including "''[[To Sleep in a Sea of Stars]]''" by Christopher Paolini and [[Edward Bellamy]]'s "''[[Looking Backward]]''"
* [[Generation ship|Generation]]: Ships in which the destination would be reached by descendants of the original passengers. These ships would necessarily be self-sustaining and self-maintaining for possibly thousands of years. Notable examples of this in fiction are the ''Godspeed'' in Beth Revis' "''[[Across the Universe (Revis novel)|Across the Universe]]''" (and subsequent sequels), as well as the ''Vanguard'' from [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s "[[Orphans of the Sky]]"

* [[Theory of relativity|Relativistic]]: Ships that function by taking advantage of [[time dilation]] at close-to-light-speeds, so long trips will seem much shorter (but still take the same amount of time for outside observers).
* Frame shift: Ships that take advantage of the fact that certain dimensions are less "folded" than others, to allow shorter travel by shifting one's [[frame of reference]] into a higher, more flat dimension to cut down on travel time, such as in science fiction with inter-dimensional [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]]. Generally this results in speeds close to (but importantly, not greater than) light speed.
* [[Faster-than-light]] (FTL): A ship that functions by reaching a destination faster than the speed of light. While according to the [[special theory of relativity]], faster-than-light travel is impossible, drives like a [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp drive]] or using a [[wormhole]], that is in principle similar have been hypothesized.

===Theoretical possibilities===
[[File:Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA.jpg|thumb|Artist's depiction of a hypothetical ''Wormhole Induction Propelled Spacecraft'', based loosely on the 1994 [[Alcubierre drive|"warp drive"]] paper of [[Miguel Alcubierre]]]]

The [[Alcubierre drive]] is a speculative [[warp drive]] conjectured by Mexican physicist [[Miguel Alcubierre]] in a 1994 paper which has not been [[peer-review]]ed.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Alcubierre |first=Miguel |title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity |url=https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001/meta |publisher=[[Institute of Physics]] | journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]] |volume=11 |number=5 |date=1994|pages=L73–L77 |doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001 |arxiv=gr-qc/0009013 |bibcode=1994CQGra..11L..73A |s2cid=4797900 }} (Letter to the Editor)</ref> The paper suggests that space itself could be topographically warped to create a local region of spacetime wherein the region ahead of the "warp bubble" is compressed, allowed to resume normalcy within the bubble, and then rapidly expanded behind the bubble creating an effect that results in apparent FTL travel, all in a manner consistent with the Einstein field equations of [[general relativity]] and without the introduction of wormholes.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Alcubierre |first=Miguel |title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity | doi=	10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001 |date=5 September 2000|volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=L73–L77 |arxiv=gr-qc/0009013 |bibcode=1994CQGra..11L..73A |s2cid=4797900 }}</ref> However, the actual construction of such a drive would face other [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|serious theoretical difficulties]].
